They found that inhaling a mist with a salt content of 7 or 9 % improved lung function and , in some cases , produced less absenteeism from school or work .
The team found that the 83 volunteers who regularly inhaled a 7 % mist of salty water had fewer breathing problems and less absenteeism from school or work than those who inhaled a solution with a salt content of under 1 %.
The Australian and German researchers say the discovery may help scientists to develop vaccines that restore immunity in people with systemic or ' whole body ' infections .
The immune response is alerted when specialised sentries of the immune system , dendritic cells , detect a virus or bacteria .
They alert the immune system by capturing infected cells and displaying fragments or antigens of the pathogen on their surface in a process called cross - presentation .
Lead researcher Dr Jose Villadangos , an immunologist from the Walter and Eliza Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne , says systemic infections such as malaria or sepsis , a bacterial infection of the blood , overstimulate dendritic cells .
" We should be able to take dendritic cells from a patient with sepsis or malaria and expose them to antigens of the virus of a secondary infection and inject them back into the patient .
" This may be because we have an affective or emotional system that [ works ] independently of our cognitive system ."
Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards .-- She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .
Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake .
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne .
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .
She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two .
Such were Elizabeth Elliot ' s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .
She felt herself ill - used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne .
From house to house he goes , A messenger small and slight , And whether it rains or snows , He sleeps outside in the night .
" If I could but make their work easier , or give the hungry ones food , or the thirsty a drink !"
They hadn ' t any little girls or any little boys , at all .
His mother and his father cherish him ; he nestles on their knees in the red firelight at night , while they read to him lovely stories , or sing sweet old songs to him ,-- the happy little boy !
The villagers heard him , but they thought it was another mean trick ; no one paid the least attention , or went near him .
" When I don ' t see any little crabs on the shore , or sticking up out of the water , I usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water ; the little bubbles go _puff , puff , puff_ , and then they go _pop , pop , pop_ , and they show me where the little juicy crabs are , so I can put my paw in and catch them .
Now the old Alligator found this out , and he made up his mind to have the little Jackal for supper , or to die trying .
The old Alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to be the little House , or the little Jackal would never come in .
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ' and what is the use of a book ,' thought Alice ' without pictures or conversation ?'
( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT - POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat - pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit - hole under the hedge .
Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think --' ( for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over ) '-- yes , that ' s about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ' ve got to ?'
( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say .)
Please , Ma ' am , is this New Zealand or Australia ?'
either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them .
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , (' which certainly was not here before ,' said Alice ,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' DRINK ME ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .

The King hath happily receiu ' d , Macbeth , The newes of thy successe : and when he reades Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight , His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend , Which should be thine , or his : silenc ' d with that , In viewing o ' re the rest o ' th ' selfe - same day , He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes , Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make Strange Images of death , as thick as Tale Can post with post , and euery one did beare Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence , And powr ' d them downe before him

Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft ' s side , to give a bias of any sort .
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .
), they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma ' s head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard ' s captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow !
He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him " poor Richard ," been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick Musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead .

Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable .
I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."
It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove ' s respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters .
She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware .
And the happy Little Fir Tree spent all his time wondering what it could be that he was just little enough for ; he knew it could hardly be a mast or a house , since he was going away with children .
The Little Fir Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little white beds in it , of children propped up on pillows in the beds , and of other children in great wheeled chairs , and others hobbling about or sitting in little chairs .
And they gave them terrible tasks to do , without proper rest , or food , or clothes .
It is not fair or just that you should eat me , when I set you free ."
If this population did not cross with modern humans , or almost did not , the effect is too small to explain the data .
The researchers agree with recent studies that conclude Neanderthals did not contribute any mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , genetic material that is passed from mothers to children .
The embryo at that stage is no longer able to divide into twins but the cells can still form any cell or tissue in the body .
Lanza ' s team managed to get 19 different cells to grow and got two stem - cell batches , or lines .
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : ' Twenty - four hours , I THINK ; or is it twelve ?
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
' IF I don ' t take this child away with me ,' thought Alice , ' they ' re sure to kill it in a day or two : wouldn ' t it be murder to leave it behind ?'
But you know -- if you don ' t , you will when you are grown up -- that no matter how clever you are , sooner or later you surely meet some one who is more clever .
When they had gone , leaving the poor Camel half killed , the little Jackal came dancing back from somewhere or other .
The Nightingale sang so beautifully that everybody who heard her remembered her song better than anything else that he heard or saw .
Behind the cottage were apple trees , a plum tree , and two or three pear trees ; then came a stretch of rough grass , and then a stone wall , with a gate leading into the fields .
If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can .
Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .
" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy ," said the Admiral ; " but there is no saying which .

The new teddy is designed to recognise you , respond if you cuddle it and tell medical staff if anything ' s wrong An electronic teddy bear inspired by therapeutic companion animals could offer hospital and nursing home patients a meaningful form of treatment without the worry of allergies , bites or maintenance .
The bear is also designed to monitor the patient , alert nearby nurses when the person may need help or more intensive , long - term care and even gather information about the interaction that can be used to better understand the relationship later .
" We are designing the Huggable to be much more than a fun , interactive robotic companion , but rather to function as a team member that works with both the patient or resident and the hospital or nursing home staff with the ultimate goal of promoting the wellbeing of the person ," says Walter Dan Stiehl , a PhD candidate at MIT and the team leader for the project .
' And be quick about it ,' added the Hatter , ' or you ' ll be asleep again before it ' s done .'
' They lived on treacle ,' said the Dormouse , after thinking a minute or two .
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , ' It was a treacle - well .'
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot .
