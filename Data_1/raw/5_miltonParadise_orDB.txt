Of Man ' s first disobedience , and the fruit Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste Brought death into the World , and all our woe , With loss of Eden , till one greater Man Restore us , and regain the blissful seat , Sing , Heavenly Muse , that , on the secret top Of Oreb , or of Sinai , didst inspire That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed In the beginning how the heavens and earth Rose out of Chaos : or , if Sion hill Delight thee more , and Siloa ' s brook that flowed Fast by the oracle of God , I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song , That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th ' Aonian mount , while it pursues Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme .
Yet not for those , Nor what the potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict , do I repent , or change , Though changed in outward lustre , that fixed mind , And high disdain from sense of injured merit , That with the Mightiest raised me to contend , And to the fierce contentions brought along Innumerable force of Spirits armed , That durst dislike his reign , and , me preferring , His utmost power with adverse power opposed In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven , And shook his throne .
All is not lost -- the unconquerable will , And study of revenge , immortal hate , And courage never to submit or yield : And what is else not to be overcome ?
That glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me .
To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee , and deify his power Who , from the terror of this arm , so late Doubted his empire -- that were low indeed ; That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall ; since , by fate , the strength of Gods , And this empyreal sybstance , cannot fail ; Since , through experience of this great event , In arms not worse , in foresight much advanced , We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal war , Irreconcilable to our grand Foe , Who now triumphs , and in th ' excess of joy Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven ."
So spake th ' apostate Angel , though in pain , Vaunting aloud , but racked with deep despair ; And him thus answered soon his bold compeer :-- " O Prince , O Chief of many throned Powers That led th ' embattled Seraphim to war Under thy conduct , and , in dreadful deeds Fearless , endangered Heaven ' s perpetual King , And put to proof his high supremacy , Whether upheld by strength , or chance , or fate , Too well I see and rue the dire event That , with sad overthrow and foul defeat , Hath lost us Heaven , and all this mighty host In horrible destruction laid thus low , As far as Gods and heavenly Essences Can perish : for the mind and spirit remains Invincible , and vigour soon returns , Though all our glory extinct , and happy state Here swallowed up in endless misery .
What can it the avail though yet we feel Strength undiminished , or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment ?"
Whereto with speedy words th ' Arch - Fiend replied :-- " Fallen Cherub , to be weak is miserable , Doing or suffering : but of this be sure -- To do aught good never will be our task , But ever to do ill our sole delight , As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist .
Thus Satan , talking to his nearest mate , With head uplift above the wave , and eyes That sparkling blazed ; his other parts besides Prone on the flood , extended long and large , Lay floating many a rood , in bulk as huge As whom the fables name of monstrous size , Titanian or Earth - born , that warred on Jove , Briareos or Typhon , whom the den By ancient Tarsus held , or that sea - beast Leviathan , which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th ' ocean - stream .
So stretched out huge in length the Arch - fiend lay , Chained on the burning lake ; nor ever thence Had risen , or heaved his head , but that the will And high permission of all - ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs , That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation , while he sought Evil to others , and enraged might see How all his malice served but to bring forth Infinite goodness , grace , and mercy , shewn On Man by him seduced , but on himself Treble confusion , wrath , and vengeance poured .
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight Aloft , incumbent on the dusky air , That felt unusual weight ; till on dry land He lights -- if it were land that ever burned With solid , as the lake with liquid fire , And such appeared in hue as when the force Of subterranean wind transprots a hill Torn from Pelorus , or the shattered side Of thundering Etna , whose combustible And fuelled entrails , thence conceiving fire , Sublimed with mineral fury , aid the winds , And leave a singed bottom all involved With stench and smoke .
and thou , profoundest Hell , Receive thy new possessor -- one who brings A mind not to be changed by place or time .
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends , Th ' associates and co - partners of our loss , Lie thus astonished on th ' oblivious pool , And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy mansion , or once more With rallied arms to try what may be yet Regained in Heaven , or what more lost in Hell ?"
The broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the moon , whose orb Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views At evening , from the top of Fesole , Or in Valdarno , to descry new lands , Rivers , or mountains , in her spotty globe .
Nathless he so endured , till on the beach Of that inflamed sea he stood , and called His legions -- Angel Forms , who lay entranced Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks In Vallombrosa , where th ' Etrurian shades High over - arched embower ; or scattered sedge Afloat , when with fierce winds Orion armed Hath vexed the Red - Sea coast , whose waves o ' erthrew Busiris and his Memphian chivalry , While with perfidious hatred they pursued The sojourners of Goshen , who beheld From the safe shore their floating carcases And broken chariot - wheels .
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conqueror , who now beholds Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood With scattered arms and ensigns , till anon His swift pursuers from Heaven - gates discern Th ' advantage , and , descending , tread us down Thus drooping , or with linked thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf ?
Awake , arise , or be for ever fallen !"
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight In which they were , or the fierce pains not feel ; Yet to their General ' s voice they soon obeyed Innumerable .
As when the potent rod Of Amram ' s son , in Egypt ' s evil day , Waved round the coast , up - called a pitchy cloud Of locusts , warping on the eastern wind , That o ' er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night , and darkened all the land of Nile ; So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell , ' Twixt upper , nether , and surrounding fires ; Till , as a signal given , th ' uplifted spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Their course , in even balance down they light On the firm brimstone , and fill all the plain : A multitude like which the populous North Poured never from her frozen loins to pass Rhene or the Danaw , when her barbarous sons Came like a deluge on the South , and spread Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands .
For Spirits , when they please , Can either sex assume , or both ; so soft And uncompounded is their essence pure , Not tried or manacled with joint or limb , Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones , Like cumbrous flesh ; but , in what shape they choose , Dilated or condensed , bright or obscure , Can execute their airy purposes , And works of love or enmity fulfil .
Belial came last ; than whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven , or more gross to love Vice for itself .
These , first in Crete And Ida known , thence on the snowy top Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air , Their highest heaven ; or on the Delphian cliff , Or in Dodona , and through all the bounds Of Doric land ; or who with Saturn old Fled over Adria to th ' Hesperian fields , And o ' er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles .
Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and soft recorders -- such as raised To height of noblest temper heroes old Arming to battle , and instead of rage Deliberate valour breathed , firm , and unmoved With dread of death to flight or foul retreat ; Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches troubled thoughts , and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds .
And now his heart Distends with pride , and , hardening in his strength , Glories : for never , since created Man , Met such embodied force as , named with these , Could merit more than that small infantry Warred on by cranes -- though all the giant brood Of Phlegra with th ' heroic race were joined That fought at Thebes and Ilium , on each side Mixed with auxiliar gods ; and what resounds In fable or romance of Uther ' s son , Begirt with British and Armoric knights ; And all who since , baptized or infidel , Jousted in Aspramont , or Montalban , Damasco , or Marocco , or Trebisond , Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore When Charlemain with all his peerage fell By Fontarabbia .
His form had yet not lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than Archangel ruined , and th ' excess Of glory obscured : as when the sun new - risen Looks through the horizontal misty air Shorn of his beams , or , from behind the moon , In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations , and with fear of change Perplexes monarchs .
Cruel his eye , but cast Signs of remorse and passion , to behold The fellows of his crime , the followers rather ( Far other once beheld in bliss ), condemned For ever now to have their lot in pain -- Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced Of Heaven , and from eteranl splendours flung For his revolt -- yet faithful how they stood , Their glory withered ; as , when heaven ' s fire Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines , With singed top their stately growth , though bare , Stands on the blasted heath .
But what power of mind , Forseeing or presaging , from the depth Of knowledge past or present , could have feared How such united force of gods , how such As stood like these , could ever know repulse ?
For me , be witness all the host of Heaven , If counsels different , or danger shunned By me , have lost our hopes .
But he who reigns Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure Sat on his throne , upheld by old repute , Consent or custom , and his regal state Put forth at full , but still his strength concealed -- Which tempted our attempt , and wrought our fall .
Henceforth his might we know , and know our own , So as not either to provoke , or dread New war provoked : our better part remains To work in close design , by fraud or guile , What force effected not ; that he no less At length from us may find , who overcomes By force hath overcome but half his foe .
Thither , if but to pry , shall be perhaps Our first eruption -- thither , or elsewhere ; For this infernal pit shall never hold Celestial Spirits in bondage , nor th ' Abyss Long under darkness cover .
War , then , war Open or understood , must be resolved ."
Mammon led them on -- Mammon , the least erected Spirit that fell From Heaven ; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent , admiring more The riches of heaven ' s pavement , trodden gold , Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed In vision beatific .
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge Rose like an exhalation , with the sound Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet -- Built like a temple , where pilasters round Were set , and Doric pillars overlaid With golden architrave ; nor did there want Cornice or frieze , with bossy sculptures graven ; The roof was fretted gold .
Not Babylon Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equalled in all their glories , to enshrine Belus or Serapis their gods , or seat Their kings , when Egypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxury .
Nor was his name unheard or unadored In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land Men called him Mulciber ; and how he fell From Heaven they fabled , thrown by angry Jove Sheer o ' er the crystal battlements : from morn To noon he fell , from noon to dewy eve , A summer ' s day , and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith , like a falling star , On Lemnos , th ' Aegaean isle .
Their summons called From every band and squared regiment By place or choice the worthiest : they anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended .
All access was thronged ; the gates And porches wide , but chief the spacious hall ( Though like a covered field , where champions bold Wont ride in armed , and at the Soldan ' s chair Defied the best of Paynim chivalry To mortal combat , or career with lance ), Thick swarmed , both on the ground and in the air , Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings .
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive In clusters ; they among fresh dews and flowers Fly to and fro , or on the smoothed plank , The suburb of their straw - built citadel , New rubbed with balm , expatiate , and confer Their state - affairs : so thick the airy crowd Swarmed and were straitened ; till , the signal given , Behold a wonder !
They but now who seemed In bigness to surpass Earth ' s giant sons , Now less than smallest dwarfs , in narrow room Throng numberless -- like that pygmean race Beyond the Indian mount ; or faery elves , Whose midnight revels , by a forest - side Or fountain , some belated peasant sees , Or dreams he sees , while overhead the Moon Sits arbitress , and nearer to the Earth Wheels her pale course : they , on their mirth and dance Intent , with jocund music charm his ear ; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds .
High on a throne of royal state , which far Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind , Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold , Satan exalted sat , by merit raised To that bad eminence ; and , from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope , aspires Beyond thus high , insatiate to pursue Vain war with Heaven ; and , by success untaught , His proud imaginations thus displayed :-- " Powers and Dominions , Deities of Heaven !-- For , since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigour , though oppressed and fallen , I give not Heaven for lost : from this descent Celestial Virtues rising will appear More glorious and more dread than from no fall , And trust themselves to fear no second fate !-- Me though just right , and the fixed laws of Heaven , Did first create your leader -- next , free choice With what besides in council or in fight Hath been achieved of merit -- yet this loss , Thus far at least recovered , hath much more Established in a safe , unenvied throne , Yielded with full consent .
With this advantage , then , To union , and firm faith , and firm accord , More than can be in Heaven , we now return To claim our just inheritance of old , Surer to prosper than prosperity Could have assured us ; and by what best way , Whether of open war or covert guile , We now debate .
His trust was with th ' Eternal to be deemed Equal in strength , and rather than be less Cared not to be at all ; with that care lost Went all his fear : of God , or Hell , or worse , He recked not , and these words thereafter spake :-- " My sentence is for open war .
Of wiles , More unexpert , I boast not : them let those Contrive who need , or when they need ; not now .
The towers of Heaven are filled With armed watch , that render all access Impregnable : oft on the bodering Deep Encamp their legions , or with obscure wing Scout far and wide into the realm of Night , Scorning surprise .
And who knows , Let this be good , whether our angry Foe Can give it , or will ever ?
Will he , so wise , let loose at once his ire , Belike through impotence or unaware , To give his enemies their wish , and end Them in his anger whom his anger saves To punish endless ?
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires , Awaked , should blow them into sevenfold rage , And plunge us in the flames ; or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us ?
What if all Her stores were opened , and this firmament Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire , Impendent horrors , threatening hideous fall One day upon our heads ; while we perhaps , Designing or exhorting glorious war , Caught in a fiery tempest , shall be hurled , Each on his rock transfixed , the sport and prey Or racking whirlwinds , or for ever sunk Under yon boiling ocean , wrapt in chains , There to converse with everlasting groans , Unrespited , unpitied , unreprieved , Ages of hopeless end ?
War , therefore , open or concealed , alike My voice dissuades ; for what can force or guile With him , or who deceive his mind , whose eye Views all things at one view ?
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold And venturous , if that fail them , shrink , and fear What yet they know must follow -- to endure Exile , or igominy , or bonds , or pain , The sentence of their Conqueror .
Our purer essence then will overcome Their noxious vapour ; or , inured , not feel ; Or , changed at length , and to the place conformed In temper and in nature , will receive Familiar the fierce heat ; and , void of pain , This horror will grow mild , this darkness light ; Besides what hope the never - ending flight Of future days may bring , what chance , what change Worth waiting -- since our present lot appears For happy though but ill , for ill not worst , If we procure not to ourselves more woe ."
Thus Belial , with words clothed in reason ' s garb , Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth , Not peace ; and after him thus Mammon spake :-- " Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven We war , if war be best , or to regain Our own right lost .
This desert soil Wants not her hidden lustre , gems and gold ; Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise Magnificence ; and what can Heaven show more ?
For he , to be sure , In height or depth , still first and last will reign Sole king , and of his kingdom lose no part By our revolt , but over Hell extend His empire , and with iron sceptre rule Us here , as with his golden those in Heaven .
War hath determined us and foiled with loss Irreparable ; terms of peace yet none Vouchsafed or sought ; for what peace will be given To us enslaved , but custody severe , And stripes and arbitrary punishment Inflicted ?
Nor will occasion want , nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heaven , whose high walls fear no assault or siege , Or ambush from the Deep .
Though Heaven be shut , And Heaven ' s high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength , this place may lie exposed , The utmost border of his kingdom , left To their defence who hold it : here , perhaps , Some advantageous act may be achieved By sudden onset -- either with Hell - fire To waste his whole creation , or possess All as our own , and drive , as we were driven , The puny habitants ; or , if not drive , Seduce them to our party , that their God May prove their foe , and with repenting hand Abolish his own works .
Advise if this be worth Attempting , or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain empires ."
The bold design Pleased highly those infernal States , and joy Sparkled in all their eyes : with full assent They vote : whereat his speech he thus renews :-- " Well have ye judged , well ended long debate , Synod of Gods , and , like to what ye are , Great things resolved , which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up , in spite of fate , Nearer our ancient seat -- perhaps in view Of those bright confines , whence , with neighbouring arms , And opportune excursion , we may chance Re - enter Heaven ; or else in some mild zone Dwell , not unvisited of Heaven ' s fair light , Secure , and at the brightening orient beam Purge off this gloom : the soft delicious air , To heal the scar of these corrosive fires , Shall breathe her balm .
who shall tempt with wandering feet The dark , unbottomed , infinite Abyss , And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way , or spread his airy flight , Upborne with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt , ere he arrive The happy Isle ?
What strength , what art , can then Suffice , or what evasion bear him safe , Through the strict senteries and stations thick Of Angels watching round ?
This said , he sat ; and expectation held His look suspense , awaiting who appeared To second , or oppose , or undertake The perilous attempt .
None among the choice and prime Of those Heaven - warring champions could be found So hardy as to proffer or accept , Alone , the dreadful voyage ; till , at last , Satan , whom now transcendent glory raised Above his fellows , with monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth , unmoved thus spake :-- " O Progeny of Heaven !
But I should ill become this throne , O Peers , And this imperial sovereignty , adorned With splendour , armed with power , if aught proposed And judged of public moment in the shape Of difficulty or danger , could deter Me from attempting .
Go , therefore , mighty Powers , Terror of Heaven , though fallen ; intend at home , While here shall be our home , what best may ease The present misery , and render Hell More tolerable ; if there be cure or charm To respite , or deceive , or slack the pain Of this ill mansion : intermit no watch Against a wakeful foe , while I abroad Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all .
Thus they their doubtful consultations dark Ended , rejoicing in their matchless Chief : As , when from mountain - tops the dusky clouds Ascending , while the north wind sleeps , o ' erspread Heaven ' s cheerful face , the louring element Scowls o ' er the darkened landscape snow or shower , If chance the radiant sun , with farewell sweet , Extend his evening beam , the fields revive , The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds Attest their joy , that hill and valley rings .
Thence more at ease their minds , and somewhat raised By false presumptuous hope , the ranged Powers Disband ; and , wandering , each his several way Pursues , as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplexed , where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts , and entertain The irksome hours , till his great Chief return .
Part on the plain , or in the air sublime , Upon the wing or in swift race contend , As at th ' Olympian games or Pythian fields ; Part curb their fiery steeds , or shun the goal With rapid wheels , or fronted brigades form : As when , to warn proud cities , war appears Waged in the troubled sky , and armies rush To battle in the clouds ; before each van Prick forth the airy knights , and couch their spears , Till thickest legions close ; with feats of arms From either end of heaven the welkin burns .
Others , more mild , Retreated in a silent valley , sing With notes angelical to many a harp Their own heroic deeds , and hapless fall By doom of battle , and complain that Fate Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance .
Of good and evil much they argued then , Of happiness and final misery , Passion and apathy , and glory and shame : Vain wisdom all , and false philosophy !-- Yet , with a pleasing sorcery , could charm Pain for a while or anguish , and excite Fallacious hope , or arm th ' obdured breast With stubborn patience as with triple steel .
Through many a dark and dreary vale They passed , and many a region dolorous , O ' er many a frozen , many a fiery alp , Rocks , caves , lakes , fens , bogs , dens , and shades of death -- A universe of death , which God by curse Created evil , for evil only good ; Where all life dies , death lives , and Nature breeds , Perverse , all monstrous , all prodigious things , Obominable , inutterable , and worse Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived , Gorgons , and Hydras , and Chimeras dire .
As when far off at sea a fleet descried Hangs in the clouds , by equinoctial winds Close sailing from Bengala , or the isles Of Ternate and Tidore , whence merchants bring Their spicy drugs ; they on the trading flood , Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape , Ply stemming nightly toward the pole : so seemed Far off the flying Fiend .
The other Shape -- If shape it might be called that shape had none Distinguishable in member , joint , or limb ; Or substance might be called that shadow seemed , For each seemed either -- black it stood as Night , Fierce as ten Furies , terrible as Hell , And shook a dreadful dart : what seemed his head The likeness of a kingly crown had on .
Retire ; or taste thy folly , and learn by proof , Hell - born , not to contend with Spirits of Heaven ."
Back to thy punishment , False fugitive ; and to thy speed add wings , Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue Thy lingering , or with one stroke of this dart Strange horror seize thee , and pangs unfelt before ."
I fled ; but he pursued ( though more , it seems , Inflamed with lust than rage ), and , swifter far , Me overtook , his mother , all dismayed , And , in embraces forcible and foul Engendering with me , of that rape begot These yelling monsters , that with ceaseless cry Surround me , as thou saw ' st -- hourly conceived And hourly born , with sorrow infinite To me ; for , when they list , into the womb That bred them they return , and howl , and gnaw My bowels , their repast ; then , bursting forth Afresh , with conscious terrors vex me round , That rest or intermission none I find .
Be this , or aught Than this more secret , now designed , I haste To know ; and , this once known , shall soon return , And bring ye to the place where thou and Death Shall dwell at ease , and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom air , embalmed With odours .
Thus saying , from her side the fatal key , Sad instrument of all our woe , she took ; And , towards the gate rolling her bestial train , Forthwith the huge portcullis high up - drew , Which , but herself , not all the Stygian Powers Could once have moved ; then in the key - hole turns Th ' intricate wards , and every bolt and bar Of massy iron or solid rock with ease Unfastens .
For Hot , Cold , Moist , and Dry , four champions fierce , Strive here for mastery , and to battle bring Their embryon atoms : they around the flag Of each his faction , in their several clans , Light - armed or heavy , sharp , smooth , swift , or slow , Swarm populous , unnumbered as the sands Of Barca or Cyrene ' s torrid soil , Levied to side with warring winds , and poise Their lighter wings .
Nor was his ear less pealed With noises loud and ruinous ( to compare Great things with small ) than when Bellona storms With all her battering engines , bent to rase Some capital city ; or less than if this frame Of Heaven were falling , and these elements In mutiny had from her axle torn The steadfast Earth .
As when a gryphon through the wilderness With winged course , o ' er hill or moory dale , Pursues the Arimaspian , who by stealth Had from his wakeful custody purloined The guarded gold ; so eagerly the Fiend O ' er bog or steep , through strait , rough , dense , or rare , With head , hands , wings , or feet , pursues his way , And swims , or sinks , or wades , or creeps , or flies .
T ' whom Satan , turning boldly , thus :--" Ye Powers And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss , Chaos and ancient Night , I come no spy With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your realm ; but , by constraint Wandering this darksome desert , as my way Lies through your spacious empire up to light , Alone and without guide , half lost , I seek , What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds Confine with Heaven ; or , if some other place , From your dominion won , th ' Ethereal King Possesses lately , thither to arrive I travel this profound .
Sin and Death amain , Following his track ( such was the will of Heaven ) Paved after him a broad and beaten way Over the dark Abyss , whose boiling gulf Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length , From Hell continued , reaching th ' utmost orb Of this frail World ; by which the Spirits perverse With easy intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals , except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace .
Here Nature first begins Her farthest verge , and Chaos to retire , As from her outmost works , a broken foe , With tumult less and with less hostile din ; That Satan with less toil , and now with ease , Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light , And , like a weather - beaten vessel , holds Gladly the port , though shrouds and tackle torn ; Or in the emptier waste , resembling air , Weighs his spread wings , at leisure to behold Far off th ' empyreal Heaven , extended wide In circuit , undetermined square or round , With opal towers and battlements adorned Of living sapphire , once his native seat ; And , fast by , hanging in a golden chain , This pendent World , in bigness as a star Of smallest magnitude close by the moon .
Yet not the more Cease I to wander , where the Muses haunt , Clear spring , or shady grove , or sunny hill , Smit with the love of sacred song ; but chief Thee , Sion , and the flowery brooks beneath , That wash thy hallow ' d feet , and warbling flow , Nightly I visit : nor sometimes forget So were I equall ' d with them in renown , Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ; Blind Thamyris , and blind Maeonides , And Tiresias , and Phineus , prophets old : Then feed on thoughts , that voluntary move Harmonious numbers ; as the wakeful bird Sings darkling , and in shadiest covert hid Tunes her nocturnal note .
Thus with the year Seasons return ; but not to me returns Day , or the sweet approach of even or morn , Or sight of vernal bloom , or summer ' s rose , Or flocks , or herds , or human face divine ; But cloud instead , and ever - during dark Surrounds me , from the cheerful ways of men Cut off , and for the book of knowledge fair Presented with a universal blank Of nature ' s works to me expung ' d and ras ' d , And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out .
Now had the Almighty Father from above , From the pure empyrean where he sits High thron ' d above all highth , bent down his eye His own works and their works at once to view : About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as stars , and from his sight receiv ' d Beatitude past utterance ; on his right The radiant image of his glory sat , His only son ; on earth he first beheld Our two first parents , yet the only two Of mankind in the happy garden plac ' d Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love , Uninterrupted joy , unrivall ' d love , In blissful solitude ; he then survey ' d Hell and the gulf between , and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night In the dun air sublime , and ready now To stoop with wearied wings , and willing feet , On the bare outside of this world , that seem ' d Firm land imbosom ' d , without firmament , Uncertain which , in ocean or in air .
And now , Through all restraint broke loose , he wings his way Not far off Heaven , in the precincts of light , Directly towards the new created world , And man there plac ' d , with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy , or , worse , By some false guile pervert ; and shall pervert ; For man will hearken to his glozing lies , And easily transgress the sole command , Sole pledge of his obedience : So will fall He and his faithless progeny : Whose fault ?
Not free , what proof could they have given sincere Of true allegiance , constant faith or love , Where only what they needs must do appear ' d , Not what they would ?
they therefore , as to right belong $ ' d , So were created , nor can justly accuse Their Maker , or their making , or their fate , As if predestination over - rul ' d Their will dispos ' d by absolute decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew , Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault , Which had no less proved certain unforeknown .
So without least impulse or shadow of fate , Or aught by me immutably foreseen , They trespass , authors to themselves in all Both what they judge , and what they choose ; for so I form ' d them free : and free they must remain , Till they enthrall themselves ; I else must change Their nature , and revoke the high decree Unchangeable , eternal , which ordain ' d $ THeir freedom : they themselves ordain ' d their fall .
But yet all is not done ; Man disobeying , Disloyal , breaks his fealty , and sins Against the high supremacy of Heaven , Affecting God - head , and , so losing all , To expiate his treason hath nought left , But to destruction sacred and devote , He , with his whole posterity , must die , Die he or justice must ; unless for him Some other able , and as willing , pay The rigid satisfaction , death for death .
And silence was in Heaven : $ on Man ' s behalf He ask ' d , but all the heavenly quire stood mute , Patron or intercessour none appear ' d , Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture , and ransom set .
Happy for Man , so coming ; he her aid Can never seek , once dead in sins , and lost ; Atonement for himself , or offering meet , Indebted and undone , hath none to bring ; Behold me then : me for him , life for life I offer : on me let thine anger fall ; Account me Man ; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom , and this glory next to thee Freely put off , and for him lastly die Well pleased ; on me let Death wreak all his rage .
Nor shalt thou , by descending to assume Man ' s nature , lessen or degrade thine own .
Because thou hast , though throned in highest bliss Equal to God , and equally enjoying God - like fruition , quitted all , to save A world from utter loss , and hast been found By merit more than birthright Son of God , Found worthiest to be so by being good , Far more than great or high ; because in thee Love hath abounded more than glory abounds ; Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt With thee thy manhood also to this throne : Here shalt thou sit incarnate , here shalt reign Both God and Man , Son both of God and Man , Anointed universal King ; all power I give thee ; reign for ever , and assume Thy merits ; under thee , as head supreme , Thrones , Princedoms , Powers , Dominions , I reduce : All knees to thee shall bow , of them that bide In Heaven , or Earth , or under Earth in Hell .
As when a vultur on Imaus bred , Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds , Dislodging from a region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids , On hills where flocks are fed , flies toward the springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes , Indian streams ; But in his way lights on the barren plains Of Sericana , where Chineses drive With sails and wind their cany waggons light : So , on this windy sea of land , the Fiend Walked up and down alone , bent on his prey ; Alone , for other creature in this place , Living or lifeless , to be found was none ; None yet , but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like aereal vapours flew Of all things transitory and vain , when sin With vanity had filled the works of men : Both all things vain , and all who in vain things Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame , Or happiness in this or the other life ; All who have their reward on earth , the fruits Of painful superstition and blind zeal , Nought seeking but the praise of men , here find Fit retribution , empty as their deeds ; All the unaccomplished works of Nature ' s hand , Abortive , monstrous , or unkindly mixed , Dissolved on earth , fleet hither , and in vain , Till final dissolution , wander here ; Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed ; Those argent fields more likely habitants , Translated Saints , or middle Spirits hold Betwixt the angelical and human kind .
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed , And long he wandered , till at last a gleam Of dawning light turned thither - ward in haste His travelled steps : far distant he descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high ; At top whereof , but far more rich , appeared The work as of a kingly palace - gate , With frontispiece of diamond and gold Embellished ; thick with sparkling orient gems The portal shone , inimitable on earth By model , or by shading pencil , drawn .
Each stair mysteriously was meant , nor stood There always , but drawn up to Heaven sometimes Viewless ; and underneath a bright sea flowed Of jasper , or of liquid pearl , whereon Who after came from earth , failing arrived Wafted by Angels , or flew o ' er the lake Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .
The stairs were then let down , whether to dare The Fiend by easy ascent , or aggravate His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss : Direct against which opened from beneath , Just o ' er the blissful seat of Paradise , A passage down to the Earth , a passage wide , Wider by far than that of after - times Over mount Sion , and , though that were large , Over the Promised Land to God so dear ; By which , to visit oft those happy tribes , On high behests his angels to and fro Passed frequent , and his eye with choice regard From Paneas , the fount of Jordan ' s flood , To Beersaba , where the Holy Land Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore ; So wide the opening seemed , where bounds were set To darkness , such as bound the ocean wave .
; t ? kast by break of cheerful dawn Obtains the brow of some high - climbing hill , Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some foreign land First seen , or some renowned metropolis With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned , Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams : Such wonder seised , though after Heaven seen , The Spirit malign , but much more envy seised , At sight of all this world beheld so fair .
Round he surveys ( and well might , where he stood So high above the circling canopy Of night ' s extended shade ,) from eastern point Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears Andromeda far off Atlantick seas Beyond the horizon ; then from pole to pole He views in breadth , and without longer pause Down right into the world ' s first region throws His flight precipitant , and winds with ease Through the pure marble air his oblique way Amongst innumerable stars , that shone Stars distant , but nigh hand seemed other worlds ; Or other worlds they seemed , or happy isles , Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old , Fortunate fields , and groves , and flowery vales , Thrice happy isles ; but who dwelt happy there He staid not to inquire : Above them all The golden sun , in splendour likest Heaven , Allured his eye ; thither his course he bends Through the calm firmament , ( but up or down , By center , or eccentrick , hard to tell , Or longitude ,) where the great luminary Aloof the vulgar constellations thick , That from his lordly eye keep distance due , Dispenses light from far ; they , as they move Their starry dance in numbers that compute Days , months , and years , towards his all - cheering lamp Turn swift their various motions , or are turned By his magnetick beam , that gently warms The universe , and to each inward part With gentle penetration , though unseen , Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep ; So wonderously was set his station bright .
The place he found beyond expression bright , Compared with aught on earth , metal or stone ; Not all parts like , but all alike informed With radiant light , as glowing iron with fire ; If metal , part seemed gold , part silver clear ; If stone , carbuncle most or chrysolite , Ruby or topaz , to the twelve that shone In Aaron ' s breast - plate , and a stone besides Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen , That stone , or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought , In vain , though by their powerful art they bind Volatile Hermes , and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the sea , Drained through a limbeck to his native form .
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazzled ; far and wide his eye commands ; For sight no obstacle found here , nor shade , But all sun - shine , as when his beams at noon Culminate from the equator , as they now Shot upward still direct , whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall ; and the air , No where so clear , sharpened his visual ray To objects distant far , whereby he soon Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand , The same whom John saw also in the sun : His back was turned , but not his brightness hid ; Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar Circled his head , nor less his locks behind Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round ; on some great charge employed He seemed , or fixed in cogitation deep .
But first he casts to change his proper shape , Which else might work him danger or delay : And now a stripling Cherub he appears , Not of the prime , yet such as in his face Youth smiled celestial , and to every limb Suitable grace diffused , so well he feigned : Under a coronet his flowing hair In curls on either cheek played ; wings he wore Of many a coloured plume , sprinkled with gold ; His habit fit for speed succinct , and held Before his decent steps a silver wand .
He drew not nigh unheard ; the Angel bright , Ere he drew nigh , his radiant visage turned , Admonished by his ear , and straight was known The Arch - Angel Uriel , one of the seven Who in God ' s presence , nearest to his throne , Stand ready at command , and are his eyes That run through all the Heavens , or down to the Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry , O ' er sea and land : him Satan thus accosts .
Brightest Seraph , tell In which of all these shining orbs hath Man His fixed seat , or fixed seat hath none , But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell ; That I may find him , and with secret gaze Or open admiration him behold , On whom the great Creator hath bestowed Worlds , and on whom hath all these graces poured ; That both in him and all things , as is meet , The universal Maker we may praise ; Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes To deepest Hell , and , to repair that loss , Created this new happy race of Men To serve him better : Wise are all his ways .
Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know The works of God , thereby to glorify The great Work - master , leads to no excess That reaches blame , but rather merits praise The more it seems excess , that led thee hither From thy empyreal mansion thus alone , To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps , Contented with report , hear only in Heaven : For wonderful indeed are all his works , Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance always with delight ; But what created mind can comprehend Their number , or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ?
Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what to accuse , But Heaven ' s free love dealt equally to all ?
Be then his love accursed , since love or hate , To me alike , it deals eternal woe .
And higher than that wall a circling row Of goodliest trees , loaden with fairest fruit , Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue , Appeared , with gay enamelled colours mixed : On which the sun more glad impressed his beams Than in fair evening cloud , or humid bow , When God hath showered the earth ; so lovely seemed That landskip : And of pure now purer air Meets his approach , and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy , able to drive All sadness but despair : Now gentle gales , Fanning their odoriferous wings , dispense Native perfumes , and whisper whence they stole Those balmy spoils .
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill Satan had journeyed on , pensive and slow ; But further way found none , so thick entwined , As one continued brake , the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed All path of man or beast that passed that way .
One gate there only was , and that looked east On the other side : which when the arch - felon saw , Due entrance he disdained ; and , in contempt , At one flight bound high over - leaped all bound Of hill or highest wall , and sheer within Lights on his feet .
As when a prowling wolf , Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey , Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve In hurdled cotes amid the field secure , Leaps o ' er the fence with ease into the fold : Or as a thief , bent to unhoard the cash Of some rich burgher , whose substantial doors , Cross - barred and bolted fast , fear no assault , In at the window climbs , or o ' er the tiles : So clomb this first grand thief into God ' s fold ; So since into his church lewd hirelings climb .
So little knows Any , but God alone , to value right The good before him , but perverts best things To worst abuse , or to their meanest use .
Beneath him with new wonder now he views , To all delight of human sense exposed , In narrow room , Nature ' s whole wealth , yea more , A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was , by him in the east Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings , Of where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained ; Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ; And all amid them stood the tree of life , High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold ; and next to life , Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by , Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill . Southward through Eden went a river large , Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown That mountain as his garden - mould high raised Upon the rapid current , which , through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up - drawn , Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill Watered the garden ; thence united fell Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood , Which from his darksome passage now appears , And now , divided into four main streams , Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm And country , whereof here needs no account ; But rather to tell how , if Art could tell , How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks , Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold , With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain , Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field , and where the unpierced shade Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .
So passed they naked on , nor shunned the sight Of God or Angel ; for they thought no ill : So hand in hand they passed , the loveliest pair , That ever since in love ' s embraces met ; Adam the goodliest man of men since born His sons , the fairest of her daughters Eve .
About them frisking played All beasts of the earth , since wild , and of all chase In wood or wilderness , forest or den ; Sporting the lion ramped , and in his paw Dandled the kid ; bears , tigers , ounces , pards , Gambolled before them ; the unwieldy elephant , To make them mirth , used all his might , and wreathed His ? kithetmroboscis ; close the serpent sly , Insinuating , wove with Gordian twine His braided train , and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded ; others on the grass Couched , and now filled with pasture gazing sat , Or bedward ruminating ; for the sun , Declined , was hasting now with prone career To the ocean isles , and in the ascending scale Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose : When Satan still in gaze , as first he stood , Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad .
gentle pair , ye little think how nigh Your change approaches , when all these delights Will vanish , and deliver ye to woe ; More woe , the more your taste is now of joy ; Happy , but for so happy ill secured Long to continue , and this high seat your Heaven Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe As now is entered ; yet no purposed foe To you , whom I could pity thus forlorn , Though I unpitied : League with you I seek , And mutual amity , so strait , so close , That I with you must dwell , or you with me Henceforth ; my dwelling haply may not please , Like this fair Paradise , your sense ; yet such Accept your Maker ' s work ; he gave it me , Which I as freely give : Hell shall unfold , To entertain you two , her widest gates , And send forth all her kings ; there will be room , Not like these narrow limits , to receive Your numerous offspring ; if no better place , Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wronged .
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree Down he alights among the sportful herd Of those four - footed kinds , himself now one , Now other , as their shape served best his end Nearer to view his prey , and , unespied , To mark what of their state he more might learn , By word or action marked .
Gabriel , to thee thy course by lot hath given Charge and strict watch , that to this happy place No evil thing approach or enter in .
So promised he ; and Uriel to his charge Returned on that bright beam , whose point now raised Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen Beneath the Azores ; whether the prime orb , Incredible how swift , had thither rolled Diurnal , or this less volubil earth , By shorter flight to the east , had left him there Arraying with reflected purple and gold The clouds that on his western throne attend .
Fair Consort , the hour Of night , and all things now retired to rest , Mind us of like repose ; since God hath set Labour and rest , as day and night , to men Successive ; and the timely dew of sleep , Now falling with soft slumbrous weight , inclines Our eye - lids : Other creatures all day long Rove idle , unemployed , and less need rest ; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed , which declares his dignity , And the regard of Heaven on all his ways ; While other animals unactive range , And of their doings God takes no account .
Daughter of God and Man , accomplished Eve , These have their course to finish round the earth , By morrow evening , and from land to land In order , though to nations yet unborn , Ministring light prepared , they set and rise ; Lest total Darkness should by night regain Her old possession , and extinguish life In Nature and all things ; which these soft fires Not only enlighten , but with kindly heat Of various influence foment and warm , Temper or nourish , or in part shed down Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow On earth , made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the sun ' s more potent ray .
These then , though unbeheld in deep of night , Shine not in vain ; nor think , though men were none , That Heaven would want spectators , God want praise : Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth Unseen , both when we wake , and when we sleep : All these with ceaseless praise his works behold Both day and night : How often from the steep Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air , Sole , or responsive each to others note , Singing their great Creator ?
oft in bands While they keep watch , or nightly rounding walk , With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonick number joined , their songs Divide the night , and lift our thoughts to Heaven .
Thus talking , hand in hand alone they passed On to their blissful bower : it was a place Chosen by the sovran Planter , when he framed All things to Man ' s delightful use ; the roof Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and myrtle , and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf ; on either side Acanthus , and each odorous bushy shrub , Fenced up the verdant wall ; each beauteous flower , Iris all hues , roses , and jessamin , Reared high their flourished heads between , and wrought Mosaick ; underfoot the violet , Crocus , and hyacinth , with rich inlay Broidered the ground , more coloured than with stone Of costliest emblem : Other creature here , Bird , beast , insect , or worm , durst enter none , Such was their awe of Man .
In shadier bower More sacred and sequestered , though but feigned , Pan or Sylvanus never slept , nor Nymph Nor Faunus haunted .
Far be it , that I should write thee sin or blame , Or think thee unbefitting holiest place , Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets , Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced , Present , or past , as saints and patriarchs used .
Here Love his golden shafts employs , here lights His constant lamp , and waves his purple wings , Reigns here and revels ; not in the bought smile Of harlots , loveless , joyless , unendeared , Casual fruition ; nor in court - amours , Mixed dance , or wanton mask , or midnight ball , Or serenate , which the starved lover sings To his proud fair , best quitted with disdain .
ye knew me once no mate For you , there sitting where ye durst not soar : Not to know me argues yourselves unknown , The lowest of your throng ; or , if ye know , Why ask ye , and superfluous begin Your message , like to end as much in vain ?
The Fiend replied not , overcome with rage ; But , like a proud steed reined , went haughty on , Champing his iron curb : To strive or fly He held it vain ; awe from above had quelled His heart , not else dismayed .
The rest is true , they found me where they say ; But that implies not violence or harm .
Not that I less endure , or shrink from pain , Insulting Angel !
But still thy words at random , as before , Argue thy inexperience what behoves From hard assays and ill successes past A faithful leader , not to hazard all Through ways of danger by himself untried : I , therefore , I alone first undertook To wing the desolate abyss , and spy This new created world , whereof in Hell Fame is not silent , here in hope to find Better abode , and my afflicted Powers To settle here on earth , or in mid air ; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay legions dare against ; Whose easier business were to serve their Lord High up in Heaven , with songs to hymn his throne , And practised distances to cringe , not fight , To whom the warriour Angel soon replied .
On the other side , Satan , alarmed , Collecting all his might , dilated stood , Like Teneriff or Atlas , unremoved : His stature reached the sky , and on his crest Sat Horrour plumed ; nor wanted in his grasp What seemed both spear and shield : Now dreadful deeds Might have ensued , nor only Paradise In this commotion , but the starry cope Of Heaven perhaps , or all the elements At least had gone to wrack , disturbed and torn With violence of this conflict , had not soon The Eternal , to prevent such horrid fray , Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales , yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign , Wherein all things created first he weighed , The pendulous round earth with balanced air In counterpoise , now ponders all events , Battles and realms : In these he put two weights , The sequel each of parting and of fight : The latter quick up flew , and kicked the beam , Which Gabriel spying , thus bespake the Fiend .
Now Morn , her rosy steps in the eastern clime Advancing , sowed the earth with orient pearl , When Adam waked , so customed ; for his sleep Was aery - light , from pure digestion bred , And temperate vapours bland , which the only sound Of leaves and fuming rills , Aurora ' s fan , Lightly dispersed , and the shrill matin song Of birds on every bough ; so much the more His wonder was to find unwakened Eve With tresses discomposed , and glowing cheek , As through unquiet rest : He , on his side Leaning half raised , with looks of cordial love Hung over her enamoured , and beheld Beauty , which , whether waking or asleep , Shot forth peculiar graces ; then with voice Mild , as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes , Her hand soft touching , whispered thus .
glad I see Thy face , and morn returned ; for I this night ( Such night till this I never passed ) have dreamed , If dreamed , not , as I oft am wont , of thee , Works of day past , or morrow ' s next design , But of offence and trouble , which my mind Knew never till this irksome night : Methought , Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk With gentle voice ; I thought it thine : It said , ' Why sleepest thou , Eve ?
' Or envy , or what reserve forbids to taste ?
But know that in the soul Are many lesser faculties , that serve Reason as chief ; among these Fancy next Her office holds ; of all external things Which the five watchful senses represent , She forms imaginations , aery shapes , Which Reason , joining or disjoining , frames All what we affirm or what deny , and call Our knowledge or opinion ; then retires Into her private cell , when nature rests .
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes To imitate her ; but , misjoining shapes , Wild work produces oft , and most in dreams ; Ill matching words and deeds long past or late .
Evil into the mind of God or Man May come and go , so unreproved , and leave No spot or blame behind : Which gives me hope That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream , Waking thou never will consent to do .
But first , from under shady arborous roof Soon as they forth were come to open sight Of day - spring , and the sun , who , scarce up - risen , With wheels yet hovering o ' er the ocean - brim , Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray , Discovering in wide landskip all the east Of Paradise and Eden ' s happy plains , Lowly they bowed adoring , and began Their orisons , each morning duly paid In various style ; for neither various style Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise Their Maker , in fit strains pronounced , or sung Unmeditated ; such prompt eloquence Flowed from their lips , in prose or numerous verse , More tuneable than needed lute or harp To add more sweetness ; and they thus began .
Unspeakable , who sitst above these heavens To us invisible , or dimly seen In these thy lowest works ; yet these declare Thy goodness beyond thought , and power divine .
Ye Mists and Exhalations , that now rise From hill or steaming lake , dusky or gray , Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold , In honour to the world ' s great Author rise ; Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky , Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers , Rising or falling still advance his praise .
His praise , ye Winds , that from four quarters blow , Breathe soft or loud ; and , wave your tops , ye Pines , With every plant , in sign of worship wave .
Ye that in waters glide , and ye that walk The earth , and stately tread , or lowly creep ; Witness if I be silent , morn or even , To hill , or valley , fountain , or fresh shade , Made vocal by my song , and taught his praise .
Hail , universal Lord , be bounteous still To give us only good ; and if the night Have gathered aught of evil , or concealed , Disperse it , as now light dispels the dark !
On to their morning ' s rural work they haste , Among sweet dews and flowers ; where any row Of fruit - trees over - woody reached too far Their pampered boughs , and needed hands to check Fruitless embraces : or they led the vine To wed her elm ; she , spoused , about him twines Her marriageable arms , and with him brings Her dower , the adopted clusters , to adorn His barren leaves .
Go therefore , half this day as friend with friend Converse with Adam , in what bower or shade Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired , To respite his day - labour with repast , Or with repose ; and such discourse bring on , As may advise him of his happy state , Happiness in his power left free to will , Left to his own free will , his will though free , Yet mutable ; whence warn him to beware He swerve not , too secure : Tell him withal His danger , and from whom ; what enemy , Late fallen himself from Heaven , is plotting now The fall of others from like state of bliss ; By violence ?
From hence no cloud , or , to obstruct his sight , Star interposed , however small he sees , Not unconformed to other shining globes , Earth , and the garden of God , with cedars crowned Above all hills .
As when by night the glass Of Galileo , less assured , observes Imagined lands and regions in the moon : Or pilot , from amidst the Cyclades Delos or Samos first appearing , kens A cloudy spot .
Their glittering tents he passed , and now is come Into the blissful field , through groves of myrrh , And flowering odours , cassia , nard , and balm ; A wilderness of sweets ; for Nature here Wantoned as in her prime , and played at will Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet , Wild above rule or art , enormous bliss .
Him through the spicy forest onward come Adam discerned , as in the door he sat Of his cool bower , while now the mounted sun Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm Earth ' s inmost womb , more warmth than Adam needs : And Eve within , due at her hour prepared For dinner savoury fruits , of taste to please True appetite , and not disrelish thirst Of nectarous draughts between , from milky stream , Berry or grape : To whom thus Adam called .
So saying , with dispatchful looks in haste She turns , on hospitable thoughts intent What choice to choose for delicacy best , What order , so contrived as not to mix Tastes , not well joined , inelegant , but bring Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change ; Bestirs her then , and from each tender stalk Whatever Earth , all - bearing mother , yields In India East or West , or middle shore In Pontus or the Punick coast , or where Alcinous reigned , fruit of all kinds , in coat Rough , or smooth rind , or bearded husk , or shell , She gathers , tribute large , and on the board Heaps with unsparing hand ; for drink the grape She crushes , inoffensive must , and meaths From many a berry , and from sweet kernels pressed She tempers dulcet creams ; nor these to hold Wants her fit vessels pure ; then strows the ground With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed .
Adam , I therefore came ; nor art thou such Created , or such place hast here to dwell , As may not oft invite , though Spirits of Heaven , To visit thee ; lead on then where thy bower O ' ershades ; for these mid - hours , till evening rise , I have at will .
So to the sylvan lodge They came , that like Pomona ' s arbour smiled , With flowerets decked , and fragrant smells ; but Eve , Undecked save with herself , more lovely fair Than Wood - Nymph , or the fairest Goddess feigned Of three that in mount Ida naked strove , Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven ; no veil She needed , virtue - proof ; no thought infirm Altered her cheek .
So down they sat , And to their viands fell ; nor seemingly The Angel , nor in mist , the common gloss Of Theologians ; but with keen dispatch Of real hunger , and concoctive heat To transubstantiate : What redounds , transpires Through Spirits with ease ; nor wonder ; if by fire Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist Can turn , or holds it possible to turn , Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold , As from the mine .
O Adam , One Almighty is , from whom All things proceed , and up to him return , If not depraved from good , created all Such to perfection , one first matter all , Endued with various forms , various degrees Of substance , and , in things that live , of life ; But more refined , more spiritous , and pure , As nearer to him placed , or nearer tending Each in their several active spheres assigned , Till body up to spirit work , in bounds Proportioned to each kind .
So from the root Springs lighter the green stalk , from thence the leaves More aery , last the bright consummate flower Spirits odorous breathes : flowers and their fruit , Man ' s nourishment , by gradual scale sublimed , To vital spirits aspire , to animal , To intellectual ; give both life and sense , Fancy and understanding ; whence the soul Reason receives , and reason is her being , Discursive , or intuitive ; discourse Is oftest yours , the latter most is ours , Differing but in degree , of kind the same .
Time may come , when Men With Angels may participate , and find No inconvenient diet , nor too light fare ; And from these corporal nutriments perhaps Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit , Improved by tract of time , and , winged , ascend Ethereal , as we ; or may , at choice , Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell ; If ye be found obedient , and retain Unalterably firm his love entire , Whose progeny you are .
Can we want obedience then To him , or possibly his love desert , Who formed us from the dust and placed us here Full to the utmost measure of what bliss Human desires can seek or apprehend ?
God made thee perfect , not immutable ; And good he made thee , but to persevere He left it in thy power ; ordained thy will By nature free , not over - ruled by fate Inextricable , or strict necessity : Our voluntary service he requires , Not our necessitated ; such with him Finds no acceptance , nor can find ; for how Can hearts , not free , be tried whether they serve Willing or no , who will but what they must By destiny , and can no other choose ?
Myself , and all the angelick host , that stand In sight of God , enthroned , our happy state Hold , as you yours , while our obedience holds ; On other surety none : Freely we serve , Because we freely love , as in our will To love or not ; in this we stand or fall : And some are fallen , to disobedience fallen , And so from Heaven to deepest Hell ; O fall From what high state of bliss , into what woe !
Son , thou in whom my glory I behold In full resplendence , Heir of all my might , Nearly it now concerns us to be sure Of our Omnipotence , and with what arms We mean to hold what anciently we claim Of deity or empire : Such a foe Is rising , who intends to erect his throne Equal to ours , throughout the spacious north ; Nor so content , hath in his thought to try In battle , what our power is , or our right .
Mighty Father , thou thy foes Justly hast in derision , and , secure , Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain , Matter to me of glory , whom their hate Illustrates , when they see all regal power Given me to quell their pride , and in event Know whether I be dextrous to subdue Thy rebels , or be found the worst in Heaven .
Ye will not , if I trust To know ye right , or if ye know yourselves Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before By none ; and if not equal all , yet free , Equally free ; for orders and degrees Jar not with liberty , but well consist .
Who can in reason then , or right , assume Monarchy over such as live by right His equals , if in power and splendour less , In freedom equal ?
Our puissance is our own ; our own right hand Shall teach us highest deeds , by proof to try Who is our equal : Then thou shalt behold Whether by supplication we intend Address , and to begirt the almighty throne Beseeching or besieging .
Well thou didst advise ; Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly These wicked tents devoted , lest the wrath Impendent , raging into sudden flame , Distinguish not : For soon expect to feel His thunder on thy head , devouring fire .
So spake the Seraph Abdiel , faithful found Among the faithless , faithful only he ; Among innumerable false , unmoved , Unshaken , unseduced , unterrified , His loyalty he kept , his love , his zeal ; Nor number , nor example , with him wrought To swerve from truth , or change his constant mind , Though single .
On they move Indissolubly firm ; nor obvious hill , Nor straitening vale , nor wood , nor stream , divides Their perfect ranks ; for high above the ground Their march was , and the passive air upbore Their nimble tread ; as when the total kind Of birds , in orderly array on wing , Came summoned over Eden to receive Their names of thee ; so over many a tract Of Heaven they marched , and many a province wide , Tenfold the length of this terrene : At last , Far in the horizon to the north appeared From skirt to skirt a fiery region , stretched In battailous aspect , and nearer view Bristled with upright beams innumerable Of rigid spears , and helmets thronged , and shields Various , with boastful argument portrayed , The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition ; for they weened That self - same day , by fight or by surprise , To win the mount of God , and on his throne To set the Envier of his state , the proud Aspirer ; but their thoughts proved fond and vain In the mid way : Though strange to us it seemed At first , that Angel should with Angel war , And in fierce hosting meet , who wont to meet So oft in festivals of joy and love Unanimous , as sons of one great Sire , Hymning the Eternal Father : But the shout Of battle now began , and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought .
that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain , where faith and realty Remain not : Wherefore should not strength and might There fail where virtue fails , or weakest prove Where boldest , though to fight unconquerable ?
thy hope was to have reached The highth of thy aspiring unopposed , The throne of God unguarded , and his side Abandoned , at the terrour of thy power Or potent tongue : Fool ! not to think how vain Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms ; Who out of smallest things could , without end , Have raised incessant armies to defeat Thy folly ; or with solitary hand Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow , Unaided , could have finished thee , and whelmed Thy legions under darkness : But thou seest All are not of thy train ; there be , who faith Prefer , and piety to God , though then To thee not visible , when I alone Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent From all : My sect thou seest ; now learn too late How few sometimes may know , when thousands err .
This is servitude , To serve the unwise , or him who hath rebelled Against his worthier , as thine now serve thee , Thyself not free , but to thyself enthralled ; Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid .
So saying , a noble stroke he lifted high , Which hung not , but so swift with tempest fell On the proud crest of Satan , that no sight , Nor motion of swift thought , less could his shield , Such ruin intercept : Ten paces huge He back recoiled ; the tenth on bended knee His massy spear upstaid ; as if on earth Winds under ground , or waters forcing way , Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat , Half sunk with all his pines .
when Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought On either side , the least of whom could wield These elements , and arm him with the force Of all their regions : How much more of power Army against army numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring , and disturb , Though not destroy , their happy native seat ; Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent , From his strong hold of Heaven , high over - ruled And limited their might ; though numbered such As each divided legion might have seemed A numerous host ; in strength each armed hand A legion ; led in fight , yet leader seemed Each warriour single as in chief , expert When to advance , or stand , or turn the sway Of battle , open when , and when to close The ridges of grim war : No thought of flight , None of retreat , no unbecoming deed That argued fear ; each on himself relied , As only in his arm the moment lay Of victory : Deeds of eternal fame Were done , but infinite ; for wide was spread That war and various ; sometimes on firm ground A standing fight , then , soaring on main wing , Tormented all the air ; all air seemed then Conflicting fire .
Hast thou turned the least of these To flight , or if to fall , but that they rise Unvanquished , easier to transact with me That thou shouldst hope , imperious , and with threats To chase me hence ?
They ended parle , and both addressed for fight Unspeakable ; for who , though with the tongue Of Angels , can relate , or to what things Liken on earth conspicuous , that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike power ?
for likest Gods they seemed , Stood they or moved , in stature , motion , arms , Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven .
Together both with next to almighty arm Up - lifted imminent , one stroke they aimed That might determine , and not need repeat , As not of power at once ; nor odds appeared In might or swift prevention : But the sword Of Michael from the armoury of God Was given him tempered so , that neither keen Nor solid might resist that edge : it met The sword of Satan , with steep force to smite Descending , and in half cut sheer ; nor staid , But with swift wheel reverse , deep entering , shared All his right side : Then Satan first knew pain , And writhed him to and fro convolved ; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Passed through him : But the ethereal substance closed , Not long divisible ; and from the gash A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed Sanguine , such as celestial Spirits may bleed , And all his armour stained , ere while so bright .
Yet soon he healed ; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part , not as frail man In entrails , heart of head , liver or reins , Cannot but by annihilating die ; Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound Receive , no more than can the fluid air : All heart they live , all head , all eye , all ear , All intellect , all sense ; and , as they please , They limb themselves , and colour , shape , or size Assume , as ? kikes them best , condense or rare .
And now , their mightiest quelled , the battle swerved , With many an inroad gored ; deformed rout Entered , and foul disorder ; all the ground With shivered armour strown , and on a heap Chariot and charioteer lay overturned , And fiery - foaming steeds ; what stood , recoiled O ' er - wearied , through the faint Satanick host Defensive scarce , or with pale fear surprised , Then first with fear surprised , and sense of pain , Fled ignominious , to such evil brought By sin of disobedience ; till that hour Not liable to fear , or flight , or pain .
Deliverer from new Lords , leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods ; yet hard For Gods , and too unequal work we find , Against unequal arms to fight in pain , Against unpained , impassive ; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue ; for what avails Valour or strength , though matchless , quelled with pain Which all subdues , and makes remiss the hands Of mightiest ?
He , who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded enemies , or arm Ourselves with like defence , to me deserves No less than for deliverance what we owe .
The invention all admired , and each , how he To be the inventer missed ; so easy it seemed Once found , which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible : Yet , haply , of thy race In future days , if malice should abound , Some one intent on mischief , or inspired With devilish machination , might devise Like instrument to plague the sons of men For sin , on war and mutual slaughter bent .
Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared , Up rose the victor - Angels , and to arms The matin trumpet sung : In arms they stood Of golden panoply , refulgent host , Soon banded ; others from the dawning hills Look round , and scouts each coast light - armed scour , Each quarter to descry the distant foe , Where lodged , or whither fled , or if for fight , In motion or in halt : Him soon they met Under spread ensigns moving nigh , in slow But firm battalion ; back with speediest sail Zophiel , of Cherubim the swiftest wing , Came flying , and in mid air aloud thus cried .
Arm , Warriours , arm for fight ; the foe at hand , Whom fled we thought , will save us long pursuit This day ; fear not his flight ; so thick a cloud He comes , and settled in his face I see Sad resolution , and secure : Let each His adamantine coat gird well , and each Fit well his helm , gripe fast his orbed shield , Borne even or high ; for this day will pour down , If I conjecture aught , no drizzling shower , But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire .
So scoffing in ambiguous words , he scarce Had ended ; when to right and left the front Divided , and to either flank retired : Which to our eyes discovered , new and strange , A triple mounted row of pillars laid On wheels ( for like to pillars most they seemed , Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir , With branches lopt , in wood or mountain felled ,) Brass , iron , stony mould , had not their mouths With hideous orifice gaped on us wide , Portending hollow truce : At each behind A Seraph stood , and in his hand a reed Stood waving tipt with fire ; while we , suspense , Collected stood within our thoughts amused , Not long ; for sudden all at once their reeds Put forth , and to a narrow vent applied With nicest touch .
Immediate in a flame , But soon obscured with smoke , all Heaven appeared , From those deep - throated engines belched , whose roar Embowelled with outrageous noise the air , And all her entrails tore , disgorging foul Their devilish glut , chained thunderbolts and hail Of iron globes ; which , on the victor host Levelled , with such impetuous fury smote , That , whom they hit , none on their feet might stand , Though standing else as rocks , but down they fell By thousands , Angel on Arch - Angel rolled ; The sooner for their arms ; unarmed , they might Have easily , as Spirits , evaded swift By quick contraction or remove ; but now Foul dissipation followed , and forced rout ; Nor served it to relax their serried files .
They , hardened more by what might most reclaim , Grieving to see his glory , at the sight Took envy ; and , aspiring to his highth , Stood re - embattled fierce , by force or fraud Weening to prosper , and at length prevail Against God and Messiah , or to fall In universal ruin last ; and now To final battle drew , disdaining flight , Or faint retreat ; when the great Son of God To all his host on either hand thus spake .
Stand still in bright array , ye Saints ; here stand , Ye Angels armed ; this day from battle rest : Faithful hath been your warfare , and of God Accepted , fearless in his righteous cause ; And as ye have received , so have ye done , Invincibly : But of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs ; Vengeance is his , or whose he sole appoints : Number to this day ' s work is not ordained , Nor multitude ; stand only , and behold God ' s indignation on these godless poured By me ; not you , but me , they have despised , Yet envied ; against me is all their rage , Because the Father , to whom in Heaven s ' preme Kingdom , and power , and glory appertains , Hath honoured me , according to his will .
At once the Four spread out their starry wings With dreadful shade contiguous , and the orbs Of his fierce chariot rolled , as with the sound Of torrent floods , or of a numerous host .
Yet half his strength he put not forth , but checked His thunder in mid volley ; for he meant Not to destroy , but root them out of Heaven : The overthrown he raised , and as a herd Of goats or timorous flock together thronged Drove them before him thunder - struck , pursued With terrours , and with furies , to the bounds And crystal wall of Heaven ; which , opening wide , Rolled inward , and a spacious gap disclosed Into the wasteful deep : The monstrous sight Struck them with horrour backward , but far worse Urged them behind : Headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heaven ; eternal wrath Burnt after them to the bottomless pit .
The meaning , not the name , I call : for thou Nor of the Muses nine , nor on the top Of old Olympus dwellest ; but , heavenly - born , Before the hills appeared , or fountain flowed , Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse , Wisdom thy sister , and with her didst play In presence of the Almighty Father , pleased With thy celestial song .
Half yet remains unsung , but narrower bound Within the visible diurnal sphere ; Standing on earth , not rapt above the pole , More safe I sing with mortal voice , unchanged To hoarse or mute , though fallen on evil days , On evil days though fallen , and evil tongues ; In darkness , and with dangers compassed round , And solitude ; yet not alone , while thou Visitest my slumbers nightly , or when morn Purples the east : still govern thou my song , Urania , and fit audience find , though few .
Say , Goddess , what ensued when Raphael , The affable Arch - Angel , had forewarned Adam , by dire example , to beware Apostasy , by what befel in Heaven To those apostates ; lest the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his race , Charged not to touch the interdicted tree , If they transgress , and slight that sole command , So easily obeyed amid the choice Of all tastes else to please their appetite , Though wandering .
Whence Adam soon repealed The doubts that in his heart arose : and now Led on , yet sinless , with desire to know What nearer might concern him , how this world Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began ; When , and whereof created ; for what cause ; What within Eden , or without , was done Before his memory ; as one whose drouth Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream , Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites , Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest .
But since thou hast vouchsafed Gently , for our instruction , to impart Things above earthly thought , which yet concerned Our knowing , as to highest wisdom seemed , Deign to descend now lower , and relate What may no less perhaps avail us known , How first began this Heaven which we behold Distant so high , with moving fires adorned Innumerable ; and this which yields or fills All space , the ambient air wide interfused Embracing round this floried Earth ; what cause Moved the Creator , in his holy rest Through all eternity , so late to build In Chaos ; and the work begun , how soon Absolved ; if unforbid thou mayest unfold What we , not to explore the secrets ask Of his eternal empire , but the more To magnify his works , the more we know .
This also thy request , with caution asked , Obtain ; though to recount almighty works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice , Or heart of man suffice to comprehend ?
Yet what thou canst attain , which best may serve To glorify the Maker , and infer Thee also happier , shall not be withheld Thy hearing ; such commission from above I have received , to answer thy desire Of knowledge within bounds ; beyond , abstain To ask ; nor let thine own inventions hope Things not revealed , which the invisible King , Only Omniscient , hath suppressed in night ; To none communicable in Earth or Heaven : Enough is left besides to search and know .
Though I , uncircumscribed myself , retire , And put not forth my goodness , which is free To act or not , Necessity and Chance Approach not me , and what I will is Fate .
Immediate are the acts of God , more swift Than time or motion , but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told , So told as earthly notion can receive .
Immediately the mountains huge appear Emergent , and their broad bare backs upheave Into the clouds ; their tops ascend the sky : So high as heaved the tumid hills , so low Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep , Capacious bed of waters : Thither they Hasted with glad precipitance , uprolled , As drops on dust conglobing from the dry : Part rise in crystal wall , or ridge direct , For haste ; such flight the great command impressed On the swift floods : As armies at the call Of trumpet ( for of armies thou hast heard ) Troop to their standard ; so the watery throng , Wave rolling after wave , where way they found , If steep , with torrent rapture , if through plain , Soft - ebbing ; nor withstood them rock or hill ; But they , or under ground , or circuit wide With serpent errour wandering , found their way , And on the washy oose deep channels wore ; Easy , ere God had bid the ground be dry , All but within those banks , where rivers now Stream , and perpetual draw their humid train .
He scarce had said , when the bare Earth , till then Desart and bare , unsightly , unadorned , Brought forth the tender grass , whose verdure clad Her universal face with pleasant green ; Then herbs of every leaf , that sudden flowered Opening their various colours , and made gay Her bosom , smelling sweet : and , these scarce blown , Forth flourished thick the clustering vine , forth crept The swelling gourd , up stood the corny reed Embattled in her field , and the humble shrub , And bush with frizzled hair implicit : Last Rose , as in dance , the stately trees , and spread Their branches hung with copious fruit , or gemmed Their blossoms : With high woods the hills were crowned ; With tufts the valleys , and each fountain side ; With borders long the rivers : that Earth now Seemed like to Heaven , a seat where Gods might dwell , Or wander with delight , and love to haunt Her sacred shades : though God had yet not rained Upon the Earth , and man to till the ground None was ; but from the Earth a dewy mist Went up , and watered all the ground , and each Plant of the field ; which , ere it was in the Earth , God made , and every herb , before it grew On the green stem : God saw that it was good : So even and morn recorded the third day .
Hither , as to their fountain , other stars Repairing , in their golden urns draw light , And hence the morning - planet gilds her horns ; By tincture or reflection they augment Their small peculiar , though from human sight So far remote , with diminution seen , First in his east the glorious lamp was seen , Regent of day , and all the horizon round Invested with bright rays , jocund to run His longitude through Heaven ' s high road ; the gray Dawn , and the Pleiades , before him danced , Shedding sweet influence : Less bright the moon , But opposite in levelled west was set , His mirrour , with full face borrowing her light From him ; for other light she needed none In that aspect , and still that distance keeps Till night ; then in the east her turn she shines , Revolved on Heaven ' s great axle , and her reign With thousand lesser lights dividual holds , With thousand thousand stars , that then appeared Spangling the hemisphere : Then first adorned With their bright luminaries that set and rose , Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day .
Forthwith the sounds and seas , each creek and bay , With fry innumerable swarm , and shoals Of fish that with their fins , and shining scales , Glide under the green wave , in sculls that oft Bank the mid sea : part single , or with mate , Graze the sea - weed their pasture , and through groves Of coral stray ; or , sporting with quick glance , Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold ; Or , in their pearly shells at ease , attend Moist nutriment ; or under rocks their food In jointed armour watch : on smooth the seal And bended dolphins play : part huge of bulk Wallowing unwieldy , enormous in their gait , Tempest the ocean : there leviathan , Hugest of living creatures , on the deep Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , And seems a moving land ; and at his gills Draws in , and at his trunk spouts out , a sea .
The Earth obeyed , and straight Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth Innumerous living creatures , perfect forms , Limbed and full grown : Out of the ground up rose , As from his lair , the wild beast where he wons In forest wild , in thicket , brake , or den ; Among the trees in pairs they rose , they walked : The cattle in the fields and meadows green : Those rare and solitary , these in flocks Pasturing at once , and in broad herds upsprung .
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground , Insect or worm : those waved their limber fans For wings , and smallest lineaments exact In all the liveries decked of summer ' s pride With spots of gold and purple , azure and green : These , as a line , their long dimension drew , Streaking the ground with sinuous trace ; not all Minims of nature ; some of serpent - kind , Wonderous in length and corpulence , involved Their snaky folds , and added wings .
And now on Earth the seventh Evening arose in Eden , for the sun Was set , and twilight from the east came on , Forerunning night ; when at the holy mount Of Heaven ' s high - seated top , the imperial throne Of Godhead , fixed for ever firm and sure , The Filial Power arrived , and sat him down With his great Father ; for he also went Invisible , yet staid , ( such privilege Hath Omnipresence ) and the work ordained , Author and End of all things ; and , from work Now resting , blessed and hallowed the seventh day , As resting on that day from all his work , But not in silence holy kept : the harp Had work and rested not ; the solemn pipe , And dulcimer , all organs of sweet stop , All sounds on fret by string or golden wire , Tempered soft tunings , intermixed with voice Choral or unison : of incense clouds , Fuming from golden censers , hid the mount .
what thought can measure thee , or tongue Relate thee !
Who can impair thee , Mighty King , or bound Thy empire !
Created in his image , there to dwell And worship him ; and in reward to rule Over his works , on earth , in sea , or air , And multiply a race of worshippers Holy and just : Thrice happy , if they know Their happiness , and persevere upright !
What thanks sufficient , or what recompence Equal , have I to render thee , divine Historian , who thus largely hast allayed The thirst I had of knowledge , and vouchsafed This friendly condescension to relate Things , else by me unsearchable ; now heard With wonder , but delight , and , as is due , With glory attributed to the high Creator !
Yet went she not , as not with such discourse Delighted , or not capable her ear Of what was high : such pleasure she reserved , Adam relating , she sole auditress ; Her husband the relater she preferred Before the Angel , and of him to ask Chose rather ; he , she knew , would intermix Grateful digressions , and solve high dispute With conjugal caresses : from his lip Not words alone pleased her .
To ask or search , I blame thee not ; for Heaven Is as the book of God before thee set , Wherein to read his wonderous works , and learn His seasons , hours , or days , or months , or years : This to attain , whether Heaven move or Earth , Imports not , if thou reckon right ; the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal , and not divulge His secrets to be scanned by them who ought Rather admire ; or , if they list to try Conjecture , he his fabrick of the Heavens Hath left to their disputes , perhaps to move His laughter at their quaint opinions wide Hereafter ; when they come to model Heaven And calculate the stars , how they will wield The mighty frame ; how build , unbuild , contrive To save appearances ; how gird the sphere With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o ' er , Cycle and epicycle , orb in orb : Already by thy reasoning this I guess , Who art to lead thy offspring , and supposest That bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright , nor Heaven such journeys run , Earth sitting still , when she alone receives The benefit : Consider first , that great Or bright infers not excellence : the Earth Though , in comparison of Heaven , so small , Nor glistering , may of solid good contain More plenty than the sun that barren shines ; Whose virtue on itself works no effect , But in the fruitful Earth ; there first received , His beams , unactive else , their vigour find .
Their wandering course now high , now low , then hid , Progressive , retrograde , or standing still , In six thou seest ; and what if seventh to these The planet earth , so stedfast though she seem , Insensibly three different motions move ?
But whether thus these things , or whether not ; But whether the sun , predominant in Heaven , Rise on the earth ; or earth rise on the sun ; He from the east his flaming road begin ; Or she from west her silent course advance , With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft axle , while she paces even , And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along ; Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid ; Leave them to God above ; him serve , and fear !
Of other creatures , as him pleases best , Wherever placed , let him dispose ; joy thou In what he gives to thee , this Paradise And thy fair Eve ; Heaven is for thee too high To know what passes there ; be lowly wise : Think only what concerns thee , and thy being ; Dream not of other worlds , what creatures there Live , in what state , condition , or degree ; Contented that thus far hath been revealed Not of Earth only , but of highest Heaven .
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove Unchecked , and of her roving is no end ; Till warned , or by experience taught , she learn , That , not to know at large of things remote From use , obscure and subtle ; but , to know That which before us lies in daily life , Is the prime wisdom : What is more , is fume , Or emptiness , or fond impertinence : And renders us , in things that most concern , Unpractised , unprepared , and still to seek .
Nor are thy lips ungraceful , Sire of men , Nor tongue ineloquent ; for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also poured Inward and outward both , his image fair : Speaking , or mute , all comeliness and grace Attends thee ; and each word , each motion , forms ; Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth Than of our fellow - servant , and inquire Gladly into the ways of God with Man : For God , we see , hath honoured thee , and set On Man his equal love : Say therefore on ; For I that day was absent , as befel , Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure , Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell ; Squared in full legion ( such command we had ) To see that none thence issued forth a spy , Or enemy , while God was in his work ; Lest he , incensed at such eruption bold , Destruction with creation might have mixed .
Fast we found , fast shut , The dismal gates , and barricadoed strong ; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise , other than the sound of dance or song , Torment , and loud lament , and furious rage .
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned , And gazed a while the ample sky ; till , raised By quick instinctive motion , up I sprung , As thitherward endeavouring , and upright Stood on my feet : about me round I saw Hill , dale , and shady woods , and sunny plains , And liquid lapse of murmuring streams ; by these , Creatures that lived and moved , and walked , or flew ; Birds on the branches warbling ; all things smiled ; With fragrance and with joy my heart o ' erflowed .
Myself I then perused , and limb by limb Surveyed , and sometimes went , and sometimes ran With supple joints , as lively vigour led : But who I was , or where , or from what cause , Knew not ; to speak I tried , and forthwith spake ; My tongue obeyed , and readily could name Whate ' er I saw .
Rejoicing , but with awe , In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss : He reared me , and ' Whom thou soughtest I am ,' Said mildly , ' Author of all this thou seest ' Above , or round about thee , or beneath .
' Not only these fair bounds , but all the Earth ' To thee and to thy race I give ; as lords ' Possess it , and all things that therein live , ' Or live in sea , or air ; beast , fish , and fowl .
O , by what name , for thou above all these , Above mankind , or aught than mankind higher , Surpassest far my naming ; how may I Adore thee , Author of this universe , And all this good to man ?
Among unequals what society Can sort , what harmony , or true delight ?
Which must be mutual , in proportion due Given and received ; but , in disparity The one intense , the other still remiss , Cannot well suit with either , but soon prove Tedious alike : Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek , fit to participate All rational delight : wherein the brute Cannot be human consort : They rejoice Each with their kind , lion with lioness ; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined : Much less can bird with beast , or fish with fowl So well converse , nor with the ox the ape ; Worse then can man with beast , and least of all .
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed Of happiness , or not ?
who am alone From all eternity ; for none I know Second to me or like , equal much less .
Thou in thy secresy although alone , Best with thyself accompanied , seekest not Social communication ; yet , so pleased , Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt Of union or communion , deified : I , by conversing , cannot these erect From prone ; nor in their ways complacence find .
He ended , or I heard no more ; for now My earthly by his heavenly overpowered , Which it had long stood under , strained to the highth In that celestial colloquy sublime , As with an object that excels the sense Dazzled and spent , sunk down ; and sought repair Of sleep , which instantly fell on me , called By Nature as in aid , and closed mine eyes .
Mine eyes he closed , but open left the cell Of fancy , my internal sight ; by which , Abstract as in a trance , methought I saw , Though sleeping , where I lay , and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood : Who stooping opened my left side , and took From thence a rib , with cordial spirits warm , And life - blood streaming fresh ; wide was the wound , But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed : The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands ; Under his forming hands a creature grew , Man - like , but different sex ; so lovely fair , That what seemed fair in all the world , seemed now Mean , or in her summed up , in her contained And in her looks ; which from that time infused Sweetness into my heart , unfelt before , And into all things from her air inspired The spirit of love and amorous delight .
She disappeared , and left me dark ; I waked To find her , or for ever to deplore Her loss , and other pleasures all abjure : When out of hope , behold her , not far off , Such as I saw her in my dream , adorned With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable : On she came , Led by her heavenly Maker , though unseen , And guided by his voice ; nor uninformed Of nuptial sanctity , and marriage rites : Grace was in all her steps , Heaven in her eye , In every gesture dignity and love .
She heard me thus ; and though divinely brought , Yet innocence , and virgin modesty , Her virtue , and the conscience of her worth , That would be wooed , and not unsought be won , Not obvious , not obtrusive , but , retired , The more desirable ; or , to say all , Nature herself , though pure of sinful thought , Wrought in her so , that , seeing me , she turned : I followed her ; she what was honour knew , And with obsequious majesty approved My pleaded reason .
Thus have I told thee all my state , and brought My story to the sum of earthly bliss , Which I enjoy ; and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed , but such As , used or not , works in the mind no change , Nor vehement desire ; these delicacies I mean of taste , sight , smell , herbs , fruits , and flowers , Walks , and the melody of birds : but here Far otherwise , transported I behold , Transported touch ; here passion first I felt , Commotion strange !
For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her the inferiour , in the mind And inward faculties , which most excel ; In outward also her resembling less His image who made both , and less expressing The character of that dominion given O ' er other creatures : Yet when I approach Her loveliness , so absolute she seems And in herself complete , so well to know Her own , that what she wills to do or say , Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best : All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded ; Wisdom in discourse with her Loses discountenanced , and like Folly shows ; Authority and Reason on her wait , As one intended first , not after made Occasionally ; and , to consummate all , Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat Build in her loveliest , and create an awe About her , as a guard angelick placed .
But if the sense of touch , whereby mankind Is propagated , seem such dear delight Beyond all other ; think the same vouchsafed To cattle and each beast ; which would not be To them made common and divulged , if aught Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue The soul of man , or passion in him move .
Neither her outside formed so fair , nor aught In procreation common to all kinds , ( Though higher of the genial bed by far , And with mysterious reverence I deem ,) So much delights me , as those graceful acts , Those thousand decencies , that daily flow From all her words and actions mixed with love And sweet compliance , which declare unfeigned Union of mind , or in us both one soul ; Harmony to behold in wedded pair More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear .
or do they mix Irradiance , virtual or immediate touch ?
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest , ( And pure thou wert created ) we enjoy In eminence ; and obstacle find none Of membrane , joint , or limb , exclusive bars ; Easier than air with air , if Spirits embrace , Total they mix , union of pure with pure Desiring , nor restrained conveyance need , As flesh to mix with flesh , or soul with soul .
But , first of all , Him , whom to love is to obey , and keep His great command ; take heed lest passion sway Thy judgement to do aught , which else free will Would not admit : thine , and of all thy sons , The weal or woe in thee is placed ; beware !
I in thy persevering shall rejoice , And all the Blest : Stand fast ; to stand or fall Free in thine own arbitrement it lies .
No more of talk where God or Angel guest With Man , as with his friend , familiar us ' d , To sit indulgent , and with him partake Rural repast ; permitting him the while Venial discourse unblam ' d .
I now must change Those notes to tragick ; foul distrust , and breach Disloyal on the part of Man , revolt , And disobedience : on the part of Heaven Now alienated , distance and distaste , Anger and just rebuke , and judgement given , That brought into this world a world of woe , Sin and her shadow Death , and Misery Death ' s harbinger : Sad talk ! yet argument Not less but more heroick than the wrath Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued Thrice fugitive about Troy wall ; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous ' d ; Or Neptune ' s ire , or Juno ' s , that so long Perplexed the Greek , and Cytherea ' s son :
00482129 If answerable style I can obtain Of my celestial patroness , who deigns Her nightly visitation unimplor ' d , And dictates to me slumbering ; or inspires Easy my unpremeditated verse : Since first this subject for heroick song Pleas ' d me long choosing , and beginning late ; Not sedulous by nature to indite Wars , hitherto the only argument Heroick deem ' d chief mastery to dissect With long and tedious havock fabled knights In battles feign ' d ; the better fortitude Of patience and heroick martyrdom Unsung ; or to describe races and games , Or tilting furniture , imblazon ' d shields , Impresses quaint , caparisons and steeds , Bases and tinsel trappings , gorgeous knights At joust and tournament ; then marshall ' d feast Serv ' d up in hall with sewers and seneshals ; The skill of artifice or office mean , Not that which justly gives heroick name To person , or to poem .
Me , of these Nor skill ' d nor studious , higher argument Remains ; sufficient of itself to raise That name , unless an age too late , or cold Climate , or years , damp my intended wing Depress ' d ; and much they may , if all be mine , Not hers , who brings it nightly to my ear .
The sun was sunk , and after him the star Of Hesperus , whose office is to bring Twilight upon the earth , short arbiter " twixt day and night , and now from end to end Night ' s hemisphere had veil ' d the horizon round : When satan , who late fled before the threats Of Gabriel out of Eden , now improv ' d In meditated fraud and malice , bent On Man ' s destruction , maugre what might hap Of heavier on himself , fearless returned From compassing the earth ; cautious of day , Since Uriel , regent of the sun , descried His entrance , and foreworned the Cherubim That kept their watch ; thence full of anguish driven , The space of seven continued nights he rode With darkness ; thrice the equinoctial line He circled ; four times crossed the car of night From pole to pole , traversing each colure ; On the eighth returned ; and , on the coast averse From entrance or Cherubick watch , by stealth Found unsuspected way .
But I in none of these Find place or refuge ; and the more I see Pleasures about me , so much more I feel Torment within me , as from the hateful siege Of contraries : all good to me becomes Bane , and in Heaven much worse would be my state .
But neither here seek I , no nor in Heaven To dwell , unless by mastering Heaven ' s Supreme ; Nor hope to be myself less miserable By what I seek , but others to make such As I , though thereby worse to me redound : For only in destroying I find ease To my relentless thoughts ; and , him destroyed , Or won to what may work his utter loss , For whom all this was made , all this will soon Follow , as to him linked in weal or woe ; In woe then ; that destruction wide may range : To me shall be the glory sole among The infernal Powers , in one day to have marred What he , Almighty styled , six nights and days Continued making ; and who knows how long Before had been contriving ?
though perhaps Not longer than since I , in one night , freed From servitude inglorious well nigh half The angelick name , and thinner left the throng Of his adorers : He , to be avenged , And to repair his numbers thus impaired , Whether such virtue spent of old now failed More Angels to create , if they at least Are his created , or , to spite us more , Determined to advance into our room A creature formed of earth , and him endow , Exalted from so base original , With heavenly spoils , our spoils : What he decreed , He effected ; Man he made , and for him built Magnificent this world , and earth his seat , Him lord pronounced ; and , O indignity !
Who aspires , must down as low As high he soared ; obnoxious , first or last , To basest things .
So saying , through each thicket dank or dry , Like a black mist low - creeping , he held on His midnight - search , where soonest he might find The serpent ; him fast - sleeping soon he found In labyrinth of many a round self - rolled , His head the midst , well stored with subtile wiles : Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den , Nor nocent yet ; but , on the grassy herb , Fearless unfeared he slept : in at his mouth The Devil entered ; and his brutal sense , In heart or head , possessing , soon inspired With act intelligential ; but his sleep Disturbed not , waiting close the approach of morn .
Adam , well may we labour still to dress This garden , still to tend plant , herb , and flower , Our pleasant task enjoined ; but , till more hands Aid us , the work under our labour grows , Luxurious by restraint ; what we by day Lop overgrown , or prune , or prop , or bind , One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wild .
Thou therefore now advise , Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present : Let us divide our labours ; thou , where choice Leads thee , or where most needs , whether to wind The woodbine round this arbour , or direct The clasping ivy where to climb ; while I , In yonder spring of roses intermixed With myrtle , find what to redress till noon : For , while so near each other thus all day Our task we choose , what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles , or object new Casual discourse draw on ; which intermits Our day ' s work , brought to little , though begun Early , and the hour of supper comes unearned ?
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed Labour , as to debar us when we need Refreshment , whether food , or talk between , Food of the mind , or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles ; for smiles from reason flow , To brute denied , and are of love the food ; Love , not the lowest end of human life .
But other doubt possesses me , lest harm Befall thee severed from me ; for thou knowest What hath been warned us , what malicious foe Envying our happiness , and of his own Despairing , seeks to work us woe and shame By sly assault ; and somewhere nigh at hand Watches , no doubt , with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage , us asunder ; Hopeless to circumvent us joined , where each To other speedy aid might lend at need : Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealty from God , or to disturb Conjugal love , than which perhaps no bliss Enjoyed by us excites his envy more ; Or this , or worse , leave not the faithful side That gave thee being , still shades thee , and protects .
The wife , where danger or dishonour lurks , Safest and seemliest by her husband stays , Who guards her , or with her the worst endures .
But , that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt To God or thee , because we have a foe May tempt it , I expected not to hear .
His violence thou fearest not , being such As we , not capable of death or pain , Can either not receive , or can repel .
His fraud is then thy fear ; which plain infers Thy equal fear , that my firm faith and love Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ; Thoughts , which how found they harbour in thy breast , Adam , mis - thought of her to thee so dear ?
I , from the influence of thy looks , receive Access in every virtue ; in thy sight More wise , more watchful , stronger , if need were Of outward strength ; while shame , thou looking on , Shame to be overcome or over - reached , Would utmost vigour raise , and raised unite .
If this be our condition , thus to dwell In narrow circuit straitened by a foe , Subtle or violent , we not endued Single with like defence , wherever met ; How are we happy , still in fear of harm ?
But harm precedes not sin : only our foe , Tempting , affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integrity : his foul esteem Sticks no dishonour on our front , but turns Foul on himself ; then wherefore shunned or feared By us ?
Let us not then suspect our happy state Left so imperfect by the Maker wise , As not secure to single or combined .
O Woman , best are all things as the will Of God ordained them : His creating hand Nothing imperfect or deficient left Of all that he created , much less Man , Or aught that might his happy state secure , Secure from outward force ; within himself The danger lies , yet lies within his power : Against his will he can receive no harm .
Thus saying , from her husband ' s hand her hand Soft she withdrew ; and , like a Wood - Nymph light , Oread or Dryad , or of Delia ' s train , Betook her to the groves ; but Delia ' s self In gait surpassed , and Goddess - like deport , Though not as she with bow and quiver armed , But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude , Guiltless of fire , had formed , or Angels brought .
To Pales , or Pomona , thus adorned , Likest she seemed , Pomona when she fled Vertumnus , or to Ceres in her prime , Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove .
Oft he to her his charge of quick return Repeated ; she to him as oft engaged To be returned by noon amid the bower , And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast , or afternoon ' s repose .
Thou never from that hour in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast , or sound repose ; Such ambush , hid among sweet flowers and shades , Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way , or send thee back Despoiled of innocence , of faith , of bliss !
In bower and field he sought , where any tuft Of grove or garden - plot more pleasant lay , Their tendance , or plantation for delight ; By fountain or by shady rivulet He sought them both , but wished his hap might find Eve separate ; he wished , but not with hope Of what so seldom chanced ; when to his wish , Beyond his hope , Eve separate he spies , Veiled in a cloud of fragrance , where she stood , Half spied , so thick the roses blushing round About her glowed , oft stooping to support Each flower of slender stalk , whose head , though gay Carnation , purple , azure , or specked with gold , Hung drooping unsustained ; them she upstays Gently with myrtle band , mindless the while Herself , though fairest unsupported flower , From her best prop so far , and storm so nigh .
Nearer he drew , and many a walk traversed Of stateliest covert , cedar , pine , or palm ; Then voluble and bold , now hid , now seen , Among thick - woven arborets , and flowers Imbordered on each bank , the hand of Eve : Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned Or of revived Adonis , or renowned Alcinous , host of old Laertes ' son ; Or that , not mystick , where the sapient king Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse .
As one who long in populous city pent , Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air , Forth issuing on a summer ' s morn , to breathe Among the pleasant villages and farms Adjoined , from each thing met conceives delight ; The smell of grain , or tedded grass , or kine , Or dairy , each rural sight , each rural sound ; If chance , with nymph - like step , fair virgin pass , What pleasing seemed , for her now pleases more ; She most , and in her look sums all delight : Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold This flowery plat , the sweet recess of Eve Thus early , thus alone : Her heavenly form Angelick , but more soft , and feminine , Her graceful innocence , her every air Of gesture , or least action , overawed His malice , and with rapine sweet bereaved His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought : That space the Evil - one abstracted stood From his own evil , and for the time remained Stupidly good ; of enmity disarmed , Of guile , of hate , of envy , of revenge : But the hot Hell that always in him burns , Though in mid Heaven , soon ended his delight , And tortures him now more , the more he sees Of pleasure , not for him ordained : then soon Fierce hate he recollects , and all his thoughts Of mischief , gratulating , thus excites .
his head Crested aloft , and carbuncle his eyes ; With burnished neck of verdant gold , erect Amidst his circling spires , that on the grass Floated redundant : pleasing was his shape And lovely ; never since of serpent - kind Lovelier , not those that in Illyria changed , Hermione and Cadmus , or the god In Epidaurus ; nor to which transformed Ammonian Jove , or Capitoline , was seen ; He with Olympias ; this with her who bore Scipio , the highth of Rome .
As when a ship , by skilful steersmen wrought Nigh river ' s mouth or foreland , where the wind Veers oft , as oft so steers , and shifts her sail : So varied he , and of his tortuous train Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve , To lure her eye ; she , busied , heard the sound Of rusling leaves , but minded not , as used To such disport before her through the field , From every beast ; more duteous at her call , Than at Circean call the herd disguised .
His gentle dumb expression turned at length The eye of Eve to mark his play ; he , glad Of her attention gained , with serpent - tongue Organick , or impulse of vocal air , His fraudulent temptation thus began .
Easy to me it is to tell thee all What thou commandest ; and right thou shouldst be obeyed : I was at first as other beasts that graze The trodden herb , of abject thoughts and low , As was my food ; nor aught but food discerned Or sex , and apprehended nothing high : Till , on a day roving the field , I chanced A goodly tree far distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed , Ruddy and gold : I nearer drew to gaze ; When from the boughs a savoury odour blown , Grateful to appetite , more pleased my sense Than smell of sweetest fennel , or the teats Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even , Unsucked of lamb or kid , that tend their play .
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon ; For , high from ground , the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adam ' s : Round the tree All other beasts that saw , with like desire Longing and envying stood , but could not reach .
Amid the tree now got , where plenty hung Tempting so nigh , to pluck and eat my fill I spared not ; for , such pleasure till that hour , At feed or fountain , never had I found .
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep I turned my thoughts , and with capacious mind Considered all things visible in Heaven , Or Earth , or Middle ; all things fair and good : But all that fair and good in thy divine Semblance , and in thy beauty ' s heavenly ray , United I beheld ; no fair to thine Equivalent or second !
Hope elevates , and joy Brightens his crest ; as when a wandering fire , Compact of unctuous vapour , which the night Condenses , and the cold environs round , Kindled through agitation to a flame , Which oft , they say , some evil Spirit attends , Hovering and blazing with delusive light , Misleads the amazed night - wanderer from his way To bogs and mires , and oft through pond or pool ; There swallowed up and lost , from succour far .
hath God then said that of the fruit Of all these garden - trees ye shall not eat , Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air $?
As when of old some orator renowned , In Athens or free Rome , where eloquence Flourished , since mute !
to some great cause addressed , Stood in himself collected ; while each part , Motion , each act , won audience ere the tongue ; Sometimes in highth began , as no delay Of preface brooking , through his zeal of right : So standing , moving , or to highth up grown , The Tempter , all impassioned , thus began .
What can your knowledge hurt him , or this tree Impart against his will , if all be his ?
He ended ; and his words , replete with guile , Into her heart too easy entrance won : Fixed on the fruit she gazed , which to behold Might tempt alone ; and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his persuasive words , impregned With reason , to her seeming , and with truth : Mean while the hour of noon drew on , and waked An eager appetite , raised by the smell So savoury of that fruit , which with desire , Inclinable now grown to touch or taste , Solicited her longing eye ; yet first Pausing a while , thus to herself she mused .
but his forbidding Commends thee more , while it infers the good By thee communicated , and our want : For good unknown sure is not had ; or , had And yet unknown , is as not had at all .
For beasts it seems : yet that one beast which first Hath tasted envies not , but brings with joy The good befallen him , author unsuspect , Friendly to man , far from deceit or guile .
rather , what know to fear Under this ignorance of good and evil , Of God or death , of law or penalty ?
shall I to him make known As yet my change , and give him to partake Full happiness with me , or rather not , But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power Without copartner ?
Confirmed then I resolve , Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe : So dear I love him , that with him all deaths I could endure , without him live no life .
But strange Hath been the cause , and wonderful to hear : This tree is not , as we are told , a tree Of danger tasted , nor to evil unknown Opening the way , but of divine effect To open eyes , and make them Gods who taste ; And hath been tasted such : The serpent wise , Or not restrained as we , or not obeying , Hath eaten of the fruit ; and is become , Not dead , as we are threatened , but thenceforth Endued with human voice and human sense , Reasoning to admiration ; and with me Persuasively hath so prevailed , that I Have also tasted , and have also found The effects to correspond ; opener mine eyes , Dim erst , dilated spirits , ampler heart , And growing up to Godhead ; which for thee Chiefly I sought , without thee can despise .
O fairest of Creation , last and best Of all God ' s works , Creature in whom excelled Whatever can to sight or thought be formed , Holy , divine , good , amiable , or sweet !
Should God create another Eve , and I Another rib afford , yet loss of thee Would never from my heart : no , no ! I feel The link of Nature draw me : flesh of flesh , Bone of my bone thou art , and from thy state Mine never shall be parted , bliss or woe .
But past who can recall , or done undo ?
Not God Omnipotent , nor Fate ; yet so Perhaps thou shalt not die , perhaps the fact Is not so heinous now , foretasted fruit , Profaned first by the serpent , by him first Made common , and unhallowed , ere our taste ; Nor yet on him found deadly ; yet he lives ; Lives , as thou saidst , and gains to live , as Man , Higher degree of life ; inducement strong To us , as likely tasting to attain Proportional ascent ; which cannot be But to be Gods , or Angels , demi - Gods .
Engaging me to emulate ; but , short Of thy perfection , how shall I attain , Adam , from whose dear side I boast me sprung , And gladly of our union hear thee speak , One heart , one soul in both ; whereof good proof This day affords , declaring thee resolved , Rather than death , or aught than death more dread , Shall separate us , linked in love so dear , To undergo with me one guilt , one crime , If any be , of tasting this fair fruit ; Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds , Direct , or by occasion , hath presented This happy trial of thy love , which else So eminently never had been known ?
So saying , she embraced him , and for joy Tenderly wept ; much won , that he his love Had so ennobled , as of choice to incur Divine displeasure for her sake , or death .
So said he , and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent ; well understood Of Eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
O Eve , in evil hour thou didst give ear To that false worm , of whomsoever taught To counterfeit Man ' s voice ; true in our fall , False in our promised rising ; since our eyes Opened we find indeed , and find we know Both good and evil ; good lost , and evil got ; Bad fruit of knowledge , if this be to know ; Which leaves us naked thus , of honour void , Of innocence , of faith , of purity , Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained , And in our faces evident the signs Of foul concupiscence ; whence evil store ; Even shame , the last of evils ; of the first Be sure then .-- How shall I behold the face Henceforth of God or Angel , erst with joy And rapture so oft beheld ?
might I here In solitude live savage ; in some glade Obscured , where highest woods , impenetrable To star or sun - light , spread their umbrage broad And brown as evening : Cover me , ye Pines !
So counselled he , and both together went Into the thickest wood ; there soon they chose The fig - tree ; not that kind for fruit renowned , But such as at this day , to Indians known , In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms Branching so broad and long , that in the ground The bended twigs take root , and daughters grow About the mother tree , a pillared shade High over - arched , and echoing walks between : There oft the Indian herdsman , shunning heat , Shelters in cool , and tends his pasturing herds At loop - holes cut through thickest shade : Those leaves They gathered , broad as Amazonian targe ; And , with what skill they had , together sewed , To gird their waist ; vain covering , if to hide Their guilt and dreaded shame !
Thus fenced , and , as they thought , their shame in part Covered , but not at rest or ease of mind , They sat them down to weep ; nor only tears Rained at their eyes , but high winds worse within Began to rise , high passions , anger , hate , Mistrust , suspicion , discord ; and shook sore Their inward state of mind , calm region once And full of peace , now tost and turbulent : For Understanding ruled not , and the Will Heard not her lore ; both in subjection now To sensual Appetite , who from beneath Usurping over sovran Reason claimed Superiour sway : From thus distempered breast , Adam , estranged in look and altered style , Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed .
Imputest thou that to my default , or will Of wandering , as thou callest it , which who knows But might as ill have happened thou being by , Or to thyself perhaps ?
Hadst thou been there , Or here the attempt , thou couldst not have discerned Fraud in the Serpent , speaking as he spake ; No ground of enmity between us known , Why he should mean me ill , or seek to harm .
But confidence then bore thee on ; secure Either to meet no danger , or to find Matter of glorious trial ; and perhaps I also erred , in overmuch admiring What seemed in thee so perfect , that I thought No evil durst attempt thee ; but I rue The errour now , which is become my crime , And thou the accuser .
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act Of Satan , done in Paradise ; and how He , in the serpent , had perverted Eve , Her husband she , to taste the fatal fruit , Was known in Heaven ; for what can ' scape the eye Of God all - seeing , or deceive his heart Omniscient ?
who , in all things wise and just , Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind Of Man , with strength entire and free will armed , Complete to have discovered and repulsed Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend .
To thee I have transferred All judgement , whether in Heaven , or Earth , or Hell .
I miss thee here , Not pleased , thus entertained with solitude , Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought : Or come I less conspicuous , or what change Absents thee , or what chance detains ?-- Come forth !
in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge ; either to undergo Myself the total crime , or to accuse My other self , the partner of my life ; Whose failing , while her faith to me remains , I should conceal , and not expose to blame By my complaint : but strict necessity Subdues me , and calamitous constraint ; Lest on my head both sin and punishment , However insupportable , be all Devolved ; though should I hold my peace , yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceal .-- This Woman , whom thou madest to be my help , And gavest me as thy perfect gift , so good , So fit , so acceptable , so divine , That from her hand I could suspect no ill , And what she did , whatever in itself , Her doing seemed to justify the deed ; She gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
or was she made thy guide , Superiour , or but equal , that to her Thou didst resign thy manhood , and the place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee , And for thee , whose perfection far excelled Hers in all real dignity ?
To whom sad Eve , with shame nigh overwhelmed , Confessing soon , yet not before her Judge Bold or loquacious , thus abashed replied .
So judged he Man , both Judge and Saviour sent ; And the instant stroke of death , denounced that day , Removed far off ; then , pitying how they stood Before him naked to the air , that now Must suffer change , disdained not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume ; As when he washed his servants feet ; so now , As father of his family , he clad Their nakedness with skins of beasts , or slain , Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid ; And thought not much to clothe his enemies ; Nor he their outward only with the skins Of beasts , but inward nakedness , much more .
It cannot be But that success attends him ; if mishap , Ere this he had returned , with fury driven By his avengers ; since no place like this Can fit his punishment , or their revenge .
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise , Wings growing , and dominion given me large Beyond this deep ; whatever draws me on , Or sympathy , or some connatural force , Powerful at greatest distance to unite , With secret amity , things of like kind , By secretest conveyance .
Then both from out Hell - gates , into the waste Wide anarchy of Chaos , damp and dark , Flew diverse ; and with power ( their power was great ) Hovering upon the waters , what they met Solid or slimy , as in raging sea Tost up and down , together crouded drove , From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell ; As when two polar winds , blowing adverse Upon the Cronian sea , together drive Mountains of ice , that stop the imagined way Beyond Petsora eastward , to the rich Cathaian coast .
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe , By Astracan , over the snowy plains , Retires ; or Bactrin Sophi , from the horns Of Turkish crescent , leaves all waste beyond The realm of Aladule , in his retreat To Tauris or Casbeen : So these , the late Heaven - banished host , left desart utmost Hell Many a dark league , reduced in careful watch Round their metropolis ; and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer , from the search Of foreign worlds : He through the midst unmarked , In show plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order , passed ; and from the door Of that Plutonian hall , invisible Ascended his high throne ; which , under state Of richest texture spread , at the upper end Was placed in regal lustre .
Down a while He sat , and round about him saw unseen : At last , as from a cloud , his fulgent head And shape star - bright appeared , or brighter ; clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him , or false glitter : All amazed At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent their aspect , and whom they wished beheld , Their mighty Chief returned : loud was the acclaim : Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers , Raised from their dark Divan , and with like joy Congratulant approached him ; who with hand Silence , and with these words attention , won .
hath given up Both his beloved Man , and all his world , To Sin and Death a prey , and so to us , Without our hazard , labour , or alarm ; To range in , and to dwell , and over Man To rule , as over all he should have ruled .
True is , me also he hath judged , or rather Me not , but the brute serpent in whose shape Man I deceived : that which to me belongs , Is enmity which he will put between Me and mankind ; I am to bruise his heel ; His seed , when is not set , shall bruise my head : A world who would not purchase with a bruise , Or much more grievous pain ?-- Ye have the account Of my performance : What remains , ye Gods , But up , and enter now into full bliss ?
So having said , a while he stood , expecting Their universal shout , and high applause , To fill his ear ; when , contrary , he hears On all sides , from innumerable tongues , A dismal universal hiss , the sound Of publick scorn ; he wondered , but not long Had leisure , wondering at himself now more , His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare ; His arms clung to his ribs ; his legs entwining Each other , till supplanted down he fell A monstrous serpent on his belly prone , Reluctant , but in vain ; a greater power Now ruled him , punished in the shape he sinned , According to his doom : he would have spoke , But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue To forked tongue ; for now were all transformed Alike , to serpents all , as accessories To his bold riot : Dreadful was the din Of hissing through the hall , thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and tail , Scorpion , and Asp , and Amphisbaena dire , Cerastes horned , Hydrus , and Elops drear , And Dipsas ; ( not so thick swarmed once the soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon , or the isle Ophiusa ,) but still greatest he the midst , Now Dragon grown , larger than whom the sun Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime , Huge Python , and his power no less he seemed Above the rest still to retain ; they all Him followed , issuing forth to the open field , Where all yet left of that revolted rout , Heaven - fallen , in station stood or just array ; Sublime with expectation when to see In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief ; They saw , but other sight instead !
There stood A grove hard by , sprung up with this their change , His will who reigns above , to aggravate Their penance , laden with fair fruit , like that Which grew in Paradise , the bait of Eve Used by the Tempter : on that prospect strange Their earnest eyes they fixed , imagining For one forbidden tree a multitude Now risen , to work them further woe or shame ; Yet , parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce , Though to delude them sent , could not abstain ; But on they rolled in heaps , and , up the trees Climbing , sat thicker than the snaky locks That curled Megaera : greedily they plucked The fruitage fair to sight , like that which grew Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed ; This more delusive , not the touch , but taste Deceived ; they , fondly thinking to allay Their appetite with gust , instead of fruit Chewed bitter ashes , which the offended taste With spattering noise rejected : oft they assayed , Hunger and thirst constraining ; drugged as oft , With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws , With soot and cinders filled ; so oft they fell Into the same illusion , not as Man Whom they triumphed once lapsed .
To me , who with eternal famine pine , Alike is Hell , or Paradise , or Heaven ; There best , where most with ravine I may meet ; Which here , though plenteous , all too little seems To stuff this maw , this vast unhide - bound corps .
This said , they both betook them several ways , Both to destroy , or unimmortal make All kinds , and for destruction to mature Sooner or later ; which the Almighty seeing , From his transcendent seat the Saints among , To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice .
To the blanc moon Her office they prescribed ; to the other five Their planetary motions , and aspects , In sextile , square , and trine , and opposite , Of noxious efficacy , and when to join In synod unbenign ; and taught the fixed Their influence malignant when to shower , Which of them rising with the sun , or falling , Should prove tempestuous : To the winds they set Their corners , when with bluster to confound Sea , air , and shore ; the thunder when to roll With terrour through the dark aereal hall .
Some say , he bid his Angels turn ascanse The poles of earth , twice ten degrees and more , From the sun ' s axle ; they with labour pushed Oblique the centrick globe : Some say , the sun Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven Atlantick Sisters , and the Spartan Twins , Up to the Tropick Crab : thence down amain By Leo , and the Virgin , and the Scales , As deep as Capricorn ; to bring in change Of seasons to each clime ; else had the spring Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers , Equal in days and nights , except to those Beyond the polar circles ; to them day Had unbenighted shone , while the low sun , To recompense his distance , in their sight Had rounded still the horizon , and not known Or east or west ; which had forbid the snow From cold Estotiland , and south as far Beneath Magellan .
Thus began Outrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first , Daughter of Sin , among the irrational Death introduced , through fierce antipathy : Beast now with beast ' gan war , and fowl with fowl , And fish with fish ; to graze the herb all leaving , Devoured each other ; nor stood much in awe Of Man , but fled him ; or , with countenance grim , Glared on him passing .
hide me from the face Of God , whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness !-- Yet well , if here would end The misery ; I deserved it , and would bear My own deservings ; but this will not serve : All that I eat or drink , or shall beget , Is propagated curse .
did I solicit thee From darkness to promote me , or here place In this delicious garden ?
But Death comes not at call ; Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries , O woods , O fountains , hillocks , dales , and bowers !
This mischief had not been befallen , And more that shall befall ; innumerable Disturbances on earth through female snares , And strait conjunction with this sex : for either He never shall find out fit mate , but such As some misfortune brings him , or mistake ; Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perverseness , but shall see her gained By a far worse ; or , if she love , withheld By parents ; or his happiest choice too late Shall meet , already linked and wedlock - bound To a fell adversary , his hate or shame : Which infinite calamity shall cause To human life , and houshold peace confound .
Adam , by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can find , Found so erroneous ; thence by just event Found so unfortunate : Nevertheless , Restored by thee , vile as I am , to place Of new acceptance , hopeful to regain Thy love , the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying , from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen , Tending to some relief of our extremes , Or end ; though sharp and sad , yet tolerable , As in our evils , and of easier choice .
But if thou judge it hard and difficult , Conversing , looking , loving , to abstain From love ' s due rights , nuptial embraces sweet ; And with desire to languish without hope , Before the present object languishing With like desire ; which would be misery And torment less than none of what we dread ; Then , both ourselves and seed at once to free From what we fear for both , let us make short , -- Let us seek Death ; -- or , he not found , supply With our own hands his office on ourselves : Why stand we longer shivering under fears , That show no end but death , and have the power , Of many ways to die the shortest choosing , Destruction with destruction to destroy ?
-- She ended here , or vehement despair Broke off the rest : so much of death her thoughts Had entertained , as dyed her cheeks with pale .
which will be lost By death brought on ourselves , or childless days Resolved , as thou proposest ; so our foe Shal ' scape his punishment ordained , and we Instead shall double ours upon our heads .
Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard , and judged , Without wrath or reviling ; we expected Immediate dissolution , which we thought Was meant by death that day ; when lo ! to thee Pains only in child - bearing were foretold , And bringing forth ; soon recompensed with joy , Fruit of thy womb : On me the curse aslope Glanced on the ground ; with labour I must earn My bread ; what harm ?
Which now the sky , with various face , begins To show us in this mountain ; while the winds Blow moist and keen , shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading trees ; which bids us seek Some better shroud , some better warmth to cherish Our limbs benummed , ere this diurnal star Leave cold the night , how we his gathered beams Reflected may with matter sere foment ; Or , by collision of two bodies , grind The air attrite to fire ; as late the clouds Justling , or pushed with winds , rude in their shock , Tine the slant lightning ; whose thwart flame , driven down Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine ; And sends a comfortable heat from far , Which might supply the sun : Such fire to use , And what may else be remedy or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought , He will instruct us praying , and of grace Beseeching him ; so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life , sustained By him with many comforts , till we end In dust , our final rest and native home .
To Heaven their prayers Flew up , nor missed the way , by envious winds Blown vagabond or frustrate : in they passed Dimensionless through heavenly doors ; then clad With incense , where the golden altar fumed , By their great intercessour , came in sight Before the Father ' s throne : them the glad Son Presenting , thus to intercede began .
Now therefore , bend thine ear To supplication ; hear his sighs , though mute ; Unskilful with what words to pray , let me Interpret for him ; me , his advocate And propitiation ; all his works on me , Good , or not good , ingraft ; my merit those Shall perfect , and for these my death shall pay .
The angelick blast Filled all the regions : from their blisful bowers Of amarantine shade , fountain or spring , By the waters of life , where ' er they sat In fellowships of joy , the sons of light Hasted , resorting to the summons high ; And took their seats ; till from his throne supreme The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will .
Michael , this my behest have thou in charge ; Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming warriours , lest the Fiend , Or in behalf of Man , or to invade Vacant possession , some new trouble raise : Haste thee , and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful pair ; From hallowed ground the unholy ; and denounce To them , and to their progeny , from thence Perpetual banishment .
He ceased ; and the arch - angelick Power prepared For swift descent ; with him the cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim : four faces each Had , like a double Janus ; all their shape Spangled with eyes more numerous than those Of Argus , and more wakeful than to drouse , Charmed with Arcadian pipe , the pastoral reed Of Hermes , or his opiate rod .
Eve , easily my faith admit , that all The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends ; But , that from us aught should ascend to Heaven So prevalent as to concern the mind Of God high - blest , or to incline his will , Hard to belief may seem ; yet this will prayer Or one short sigh of human breath , upborne Even to the seat of God .
O Eve , some further change awaits us nigh , Which Heaven , by these mute signs in Nature , shows Forerunners of his purpose ; or to warn Us , haply too secure , of our discharge From penalty , because from death released Some days : how long , and what till then our life , Who knows ?
Eve $ now expect great tidings , which perhaps Of us will soon determine , or impose New laws to be observed ; for I descry , From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill , One of the heavenly host ; and , by his gait , None of the meanest ; some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above ; such majesty Invests him coming !
He ended : and the Arch - Angel soon drew nigh , Not in his shape celestial , but as man Clad to meet man ; over his lucid arms A military vest of purple flowed , Livelier than Meliboean , or the grain Of Sarra , worn by kings and heroes old In time of truce ; Iris had dipt the woof ; His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime In manhood where youth ended ; by his side , As in a glistering zodiack , hung the sword , Satan ' s dire dread ; and in his hand the spear .
Who now shall rear ye to the sun , or rank Your tribes , and water from the ambrosial fount ?
by me adorned With what to sight or smell was sweet !
Celestial , whether among the Thrones , or named Of them the highest ; for such of shape may seem Prince above princes !
This most afflicts me , that , departing hence , As from his face I shall be hid , deprived His blessed countenance : Here I could frequent With worship place by place where he vouchsafed Presence Divine ; and to my sons relate , ' On this mount he appeared ; under this tree ' Stood visible ; among these pines his voice ' I heard ; here with him at this fountain talked : So many grateful altars I would rear Of grassy turf , and pile up every stone Of lustre from the brook , in memory , Or monument to ages ; and theron Offer sweet - smelling gums , and fruits , and flowers : In yonder nether world where shall I seek His bright appearances , or foot - step trace ?
Adam , thou knowest Heaven his , and all the Earth ; Not this rock only ; his Omnipresence fills Land , sea , and air , and every kind that lives , Fomented by his virtual power and warmed : All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule , No despicable gift ; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confined Of Paradise , or Eden : this had been Perhaps thy capital seat , from whence had spread All generations ; and had hither come From all the ends of the earth , to celebrate And reverence thee , their great progenitor .
Which that thou mayest believe , and be confirmed Ere thou from hence depart ; know , I am sent To show thee what shall come in future days To thee , and to thy offspring : good with bad Expect to hear ; supernal grace contending With sinfulness of men ; thereby to learn True patience , and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow ; equally inured By moderation either state to bear , Prosperous or adverse : so shalt thou lead Safest thy life , and best prepared endure Thy mortal passage when it comes .-- Ascend This hill ; let Eve ( for I have drenched her eyes ) Here sleep below ; while thou to foresight wakest ; As once thou sleptst , while she to life was formed .
His eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern fame , the seat Of mightiest empire , from the destined walls Of Cambalu , seat of Cathaian Can , And Samarchand by Oxus , Temir ' s throne , To Paquin of Sinaean kings ; and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul , Down to the golden Chersonese ; or where The Persian in Ecbatan sat , or since In Hispahan ; or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco ; or the Sultan in Bizance , Turchestan - born ; nor could his eye not ken The empire of Negus to his utmost port Ercoco , and the less maritim kings Mombaza , and Quiloa , and Melind , And Sofala , thought Ophir , to the realm Of Congo , and Angola farthest south ; Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount The kingdoms of Almansor , Fez and Sus , Morocco , and Algiers , and Tremisen ; On Europe thence , and where Rome was to sway The world : in spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico , the seat of Montezume , And Cusco in Peru , the richer seat Of Atabalipa ; and yet unspoiled Guiana , whose great city Geryon ' s sons Call El Dorado .
Immediately a place Before his eyes appeared , sad , noisome , dark ; A lazar - house it seemed ; wherein were laid Numbers of all diseased ; all maladies Of ghastly spasm , or racking torture , qualms Of heart - sick agony , all feverous kinds , Convulsions , epilepsies , fierce catarrhs , Intestine stone and ulcer , colick - pangs , Demoniack phrenzy , moaping melancholy , And moon - struck madness , pining atrophy , Marasmus , and wide - wasting pestilence , Dropsies , and asthmas , and joint - racking rheums .
who , if we knew What we receive , would either no accept Life offered , or soon beg to lay it down ; Glad to be so dismissed in peace .
There is , said Michael , if thou well observe The rule of Not too much ; by temperance taught , In what thou eatest and drinkest ; seeking from thence Due nourishment , not gluttonous delight , Till many years over thy head return : So mayest thou live ; till , like ripe fruit , thou drop Into thy mother ' s lap ; or be with ease Gathered , nor harshly plucked ; for death mature : This is Old Age ; but then , thou must outlive Thy youth , thy strength , thy beauty ; which will change To withered , weak , and gray ; thy senses then , Obtuse , all taste of pleasure must forego , To what thou hast ; and , for the air of youth , Hopeful and cheerful , in thy blood will reign A melancholy damp of cold and dry To weigh thy spirits down , and last consume The balm of life .
Nor love thy life , nor hate ; but what thou livest Live well ; how long , or short , permit to Heaven : And now prepare thee for another sight .
In other part stood one who , at the forge Labouring , two massy clods of iron and brass Had melted , ( whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale , Down to the veins of earth ; thence gliding hot To some cave ' s mouth ; or whether washed by stream From underground ;) the liquid ore he drained Into fit moulds prepared ; from which he formed First his own tools ; then , what might else be wrought Fusil or graven in metal .
True opener of mine eyes , prime Angel blest ; Much better seems this vision , and more hope Of peaceful days portends , than those two past ; Those were of hate and death , or pain much worse ; Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends .
O pity and shame , that they , who to live well Entered so fair , should turn aside to tread Paths indirect , or in the mid way faint !
He looked , and saw wide territory spread Before him , towns , and rural works between ; Cities of men with lofty gates and towers , Concourse in arms , fierce faces threatening war , Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise ; Part wield their arms , part curb the foaming steed , Single or in array of battle ranged Both horse and foot , nor idly mustering stood ; One way a band select from forage drives A herd of beeves , fair oxen and fair kine , From a fat meadow ground ; or fleecy flock , Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain , Their booty ; scarce with life the shepherds fly , But call in aid , which makes a bloody fray ; With cruel tournament the squadrons join ; Where cattle pastured late , now scattered lies With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field , Deserted : Others to a city strong Lay siege , encamped ; by battery , scale , and mine , Assaulting ; others from the wall defend With dart and javelin , stones , and sulphurous fire ; On each hand slaughter , and gigantick deeds .
In other part the sceptered heralds call To council , in the city - gates ; anon Gray - headed men and grave , with warriours mixed , Assemble , and harangues are heard ; but soon , In factious opposition ; till at last , Of middle age one rising , eminent In wise deport , spake much of right and wrong , Of justice , or religion , truth , and peace , And judgement from above : him old and young Exploded , and had seized with violent hands , Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence Unseen amid the throng : so violence Proceeded , and oppression , and sword - law , Through all the plain , and refuge none was found .
These are the product Of those ill - mated marriages thou sawest ; Where good with bad were matched , who of themselves Abhor to join ; and , by imprudence mixed , Produce prodigious births of body or mind .
He looked , and saw the face of things quite changed ; The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar ; All now was turned to jollity and game , To luxury and riot , feast and dance ; Marrying or prostituting , as befel , Rape or adultery , where passing fair Allured them ; thence from cups to civil broils .
At length a reverend sire among them came , And of their doings great dislike declared , And testified against their ways ; he oft Frequented their assemblies , whereso met , Triumphs or festivals ; and to them preached Conversion and repentance , as to souls In prison , under judgements imminent : But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceased Contending , and removed his tents far off ; Then , from the mountain hewing timber tall , Began to build a vessel of huge bulk ; Measured by cubit , length , and breadth , and highth ; Smeared round with pitch ; and in the side a door Contrived ; and of provisions laid in large , For man and beast : when lo , a wonder strange !
Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold , what shall befall Him or his children ; evil he may be sure , Which neither his foreknowing can prevent ; And he the future evil shall no less In apprehension than in substance feel , Grievous to bear : but that care now is past , Man is not whom to warn : those few escaped Famine and anguish will at last consume , Wandering that watery desart : I had hope , When violence was ceased , and war on earth , All would have then gone well ; peace would have crowned With length of happy days the race of Man ; But I was far deceived ; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste .
The conquered also , and enslaved by war , Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose And fear of God ; from whom their piety feigned In sharp contest of battle found no aid Against invaders ; therefore , cooled in zeal , Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure , Worldly or dissolute , on what their lords Shall leave them to enjoy ; for the earth shall bear More than enough , that temperance may be tried : So all shall turn degenerate , all depraved ; Justice and temperance , truth and faith , forgot ; One man except , the only son of light In a dark age , against example good , Against allurement , custom , and a world Offended : fearless of reproach and scorn , The grand - child , with twelve sons encreased , departs From Canaan , to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile ; See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea : To sojourn in that land He comes , invited by a younger son In time of dearth ; a son , whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that realm Of Pharaoh : There he dies , and leaves his race Growing into a nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent king , who seeks To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests Or violence , he of their wicked ways Shall them admonish ; and before them set The paths of righteousness , how much more safe And full of peace ; denouncing wrath to come On their impenitence ; and shall return Of them derided , but of God observed The one just man alive ; by his command Shall build a wonderous ark , as thou beheldst , To save himself , and houshold , from amidst A world devote to universal wrack .
No sooner he , with them of man and beast Select for life , shall in the ark be lodged , And sheltered round ; but all the cataracts Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour Rain , day and night ; all fountains of the deep , Broke up , shall heave the ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds ; till inundation rise Above the highest hills : Then shall this mount Of Paradise by might of waves be moved Out of his place , pushed by the horned flood , With all his verdure spoiled , and trees adrift , Down the great river to the opening gulf , And there take root an island salt and bare , The haunt of seals , and orcs , and sea - mews ' clang : To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctity , if none be thither brought By men who there frequent , or therein dwell .
Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies , And after him , the surer messenger , A dove sent forth once and again to spy Green tree or ground , whereon his foot may light : The second time returning , in his bill An olive - leaf he brings , pacifick sign : Anon dry ground appears , and from his ark The ancient sire descends , with all his train ; Then with uplifted hands , and eyes devout , Grateful to Heaven , over his head beholds A dewy cloud , and in the cloud a bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay , Betokening peace from God , and covenant new .
Dextrously thou aimest ; So willingly doth God remit his ire , Though late repenting him of Man depraved ; Grieved at his heart , when looking down he saw The whole earth filled with violence , and all flesh Corrupting each their way ; yet , those removed , Such grace shall one just man find in his sight , That he relents , not to blot out mankind ; And makes a covenant never to destroy The earth again by flood ; nor let the sea Surpass his bounds ; nor rain to drown the world , With man therein or beast ; but , when he brings Over the earth a cloud , will therein set His triple - coloured bow , whereon to look , And call to mind his covenant : Day and night , Seed - time and harvest , heat and hoary frost , Shall hold their course ; till fire purge all things new , Both Heaven and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell .
This second source of Men , while yet but few , And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in their minds , fearing the Deity , With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead their lives , and multiply apace ; Labouring the soil , and reaping plenteous crop , Corn , wine , and oil ; and , from the herd or flock , Oft sacrificing bullock , lamb , or kid , With large wine - offerings poured , and sacred feast , Shall spend their days in joy unblamed ; and dwell Long time in peace , by families and tribes , Under paternal rule : till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart ; who , not content With fair equality , fraternal state , Will arrogate dominion undeserved Over his brethren , and quite dispossess Concord and law of nature from the earth ; Hunting ( and men not beasts shall be his game ) With war , and hostile snare , such as refuse Subjection to his empire tyrannous : A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled Before the Lord ; as in despite of Heaven , Or from Heaven , claiming second sovranty ; And from rebellion shall derive his name , Though of rebellion others he accuse .
He with a crew , whom like ambition joins With him or under him to tyrannize , Marching from Eden towards the west , shall find The plain , wherein a black bituminous gurge Boils out from under ground , the mouth of Hell : Of brick , and of that stuff , they cast to build A city and tower , whose top may reach to Heaven ; And get themselves a name ; lest , far dispersed In foreign lands , their memory be lost ; Regardless whether good or evil fame .
Justly thou abhorrest That son , who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought , affecting to subdue Rational liberty ; yet know withal , Since thy original lapse , true liberty Is lost , which always with right reason dwells Twinned , and from her hath no dividual being : Reason in man obscured , or not obeyed , Immediately inordinate desires , And upstart passions , catch the government From reason ; and to servitude reduce Man , till then free .
But first , the lawless tyrant , who denies To know their God , or message to regard , Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire ; To blood unshed the rivers must be turned ; Frogs , lice , and flies , must all his palace fill With loathed intrusion , and fill all the land ; His cattle must of rot and murren die ; Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss , And all his people ; thunder mixed with hail , Hail mixed with fire , must rend the Egyptians sky , And wheel on the earth , devouring where it rolls ; What it devours not , herb , or fruit , or grain , A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down Must eat , and on the ground leave nothing green ; Darkness must overshadow all his bounds , Palpable darkness , and blot out three days ; Last , with one midnight stroke , all the first - born Of Egypt must lie dead .
Dream not of their fight , As of a duel , or the local wounds Of head or heel : Not therefore joins the Son Manhood to Godhead , with more strength to foil Thy enemy ; nor so is overcome Satan , whose fall from Heaven , a deadlier bruise , Disabled , not to give thee thy death ' s wound : Which he , who comes thy Saviour , shall recure , Not by destroying Satan , but his works In thee , and in thy seed : Nor can this be , But by fulfilling that which thou didst want , Obedience to the law of God , imposed On penalty of death , and suffering death ; The penalty to thy transgression due , And due to theirs which out of thine will grow : So only can high Justice rest appaid .
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend With victory , triumphing through the air Over his foes and thine ; there shall surprise The Serpent , prince of air , and drag in chains Through all his realm , and there confounded leave ; Then enter into glory , and resume His seat at God ' s right hand , exalted high Above all names in Heaven ; and thence shall come , When this world ' s dissolution shall be ripe , With glory and power to judge both quick and dead ; To judge the unfaithful dead , but to reward His faithful , and receive them into bliss , Whether in Heaven or Earth ; for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise , far happier place Than this of Eden , and far happier days .
Full of doubt I stand , Whether I should repent me now of sin By me done , and occasioned ; or rejoice Much more , that much more good thereof shall spring ; To God more glory , more good - will to Men From God , and over wrath grace shall abound .
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names , Places , and titles , and with these to join Secular power ; though feigning still to act By spiritual , to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God , promised alike and given To all believers ; and , from that pretence , Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force On every conscience ; laws which none shall find Left them inrolled , or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave .
This having learned , thou hast attained the sum Of wisdom ; hope no higher , though all the stars Thou knewest by name , and all the ethereal powers , All secrets of the deep , all Nature ' s works , Or works of God in Heaven , air , earth , or sea , And all the riches of this world enjoyedst , And all the rule , one empire ; only add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable ; add faith , Add virtue , patience , temperance ; add love , By name to come called charity , the soul Of all the rest : then wilt thou not be loth To leave this Paradise , but shalt possess A Paradise within thee , happier far .-- Let us descend now therefore from this top Of speculation ; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence ; and see ! the guards , By me encamped on yonder hill , expect Their motion ; at whose front a flaming sword , In signal of remove , waves fiercely round : We may no longer stay : go , waken Eve ; Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed Portending good , and all her spirits composed To meek submission : thou , at season fit , Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard ; Chiefly what may concern her faith to know , The great deliverance by her seed to come ( For by the Woman ' s seed ) on all mankind : That ye may live , which will be many days , Both in one faith unanimous , though sad , With cause , for evils past ; yet much more cheered With meditation on the happy end .
